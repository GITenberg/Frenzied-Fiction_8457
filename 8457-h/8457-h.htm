    <h2>
      I. My Revelations as a Spy
    </h2>
    <p>
      In many people the very name "Spy" excites a shudder of apprehension; we
      Spies, in fact, get quite used to being shuddered at. None of us Spies
      mind it at all. Whenever I enter a hotel and register myself as a Spy I am
      quite accustomed to see a thrill of fear run round the clerks, or clerk,
      behind the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Us Spies or We Spies&mdash;for we call ourselves both&mdash;are thus a
      race apart. None know us. All fear us. Where do we live? Nowhere. Where
      are we? Everywhere. Frequently we don't know ourselves where we are. The
      secret orders that we receive come from so high up that it is often
      forbidden to us even to ask where we are. A friend of mine, or at least a
      Fellow Spy&mdash;us Spies have no friends&mdash;one of the most brilliant
      men in the Hungarian Secret Service, once spent a month in New York under
      the impression that he was in Winnipeg. If this happened to the most
      brilliant, think of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      All, I say, fear us. Because they know and have reason to know our power.
      Hence, in spite of the prejudice against us, we are able to move
      everywhere, to lodge in the best hotels, and enter any society that we
      wish to penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me relate an incident to illustrate this: a month ago I entered one of
      the largest of the New York hotels which I will merely call the B. hotel
      without naming it: to do so might blast it. We Spies, in fact, never <i>name</i>
      a hotel. At the most we indicate it by a number known only to ourselves,
      such as 1, 2, or 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my presenting myself at the desk the clerk informed me that he had no
      room vacant. I knew this of course to be a mere subterfuge; whether or not
      he suspected that I was a Spy I cannot say. I was muffled up, to avoid
      recognition, in a long overcoat with the collar turned up and reaching
      well above my ears, while the black beard and the moustache, that I had
      slipped on in entering the hotel, concealed my face. "Let me speak a
      moment to the manager," I said. When he came I beckoned him aside and
      taking his ear in my hand I breathed two words into it. "Good heavens!" he
      gasped, while his face turned as pale as ashes. "Is it enough?" I asked.
      "Can I have a room, or must I breathe again?" "No, no," said the manager,
      still trembling. Then, turning to the clerk: "Give this gentleman a room,"
      he said, "and give him a bath."
    </p>
    <p>
      What these two words are that will get a room in New York at once I must
      not divulge. Even now, when the veil of secrecy is being lifted, the
      international interests involved are too complicated to permit it. Suffice
      it to say that if these two had failed I know a couple of others still
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I narrate this incident, otherwise trivial, as indicating the astounding
      ramifications and the ubiquity of the international spy system. A similar
      illustration occurs to me as I write. I was walking the other day with
      another man, on upper B. way between the T. Building and the W. Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see that man over there?" I said, pointing from the side of the
      street on which we were walking on the sidewalk to the other side opposite
      to the side that we were on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man with the straw hat?" he asked. "Yes, what of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing," I answered, "except that he's a Spy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great heavens!" exclaimed my acquaintance, leaning up against a lamp-post
      for support. "A Spy! How do you know that? What does it mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave a quiet laugh&mdash;we Spies learn to laugh very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" I said, "that is my secret, my friend. <i>Verbum sapientius! Che
      sara sara! Yodel doodle doo!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      My acquaintance fell in a dead faint upon the street. I watched them take
      him away in an ambulance. Will the reader be surprised to learn that among
      the white-coated attendants who removed him I recognized no less a person
      than the famous Russian Spy, Poulispantzoff. What he was doing there I
      could not tell. No doubt his orders came from so high up that he himself
      did not know. I had seen him only twice before&mdash;once when we were
      both disguised as Zulus at Buluwayo, and once in the interior of China, at
      the time when Poulispantzoff made his secret entry into Thibet concealed
      in a tea-case. He was inside the tea-case when I saw him; so at least I
      was informed by the coolies who carried it. Yet I recognized him
      instantly. Neither he nor I, however, gave any sign of recognition other
      than an imperceptible movement of the outer eyelid. (We Spies learn to
      move the outer lid of the eye so imperceptibly that it cannot be seen.)
      Yet after meeting Poulispantzoff in this way I was not surprised to read
      in the evening papers a few hours afterward that the uncle of the young
      King of Siam had been assassinated. The connection between these two
      events I am unfortunately not at liberty to explain; the consequences to
      the Vatican would be too serious. I doubt if it could remain top-side up.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, however, are but passing incidents in a life filled with danger and
      excitement. They would have remained unrecorded and unrevealed, like the
      rest of my revelations, were it not that certain recent events have to
      some extent removed the seal of secrecy from my lips. The death of a
      certain royal sovereign makes it possible for me to divulge things
      hitherto undivulgeable. Even now I can only tell a part, a small part, of
      the terrific things that I know. When more sovereigns die I can divulge
      more. I hope to keep on divulging at intervals for years. But I am
      compelled to be cautious. My relations with the Wilhelmstrasse, with
      Downing Street and the Quai d'Orsay, are so intimate, and my footing with
      the Yildiz Kiosk and the Waldorf-Astoria and Childs' Restaurants are so
      delicate, that a single <i>faux pas</i> might prove to be a false step.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now seventeen years since I entered the Secret Service of the G.
      empire. During this time my activities have taken me into every quarter of
      the globe, at times even into every eighth or sixteenth of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I who first brought back word to the Imperial Chancellor of the
      existence of an Entente between England and France. "Is there an Entente?"
      he asked me, trembling with excitement, on my arrival at the
      Wilhelmstrasse. "Your Excellency," I said, "there is." He groaned. "Can
      you stop it?" he asked. "Don't ask me," I said sadly. "Where must we
      strike?" demanded the Chancellor. "Fetch me a map," I said. They did so. I
      placed my finger on the map. "Quick, quick," said the Chancellor, "look
      where his finger is." They lifted it up. "Morocco!" they cried. I had
      meant it for Abyssinia but it was too late to change. That night the
      warship Panther sailed under sealed orders. The rest is history, or at
      least history and geography.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way it was I who brought word to the Wilhelmstrasse of the <i>rapprochement</i>
      between England and Russia in Persia. "What did you find?" asked the
      Chancellor as I laid aside the Russian disguise in which I had travelled.
      "A <i>Rapprochement!</i>" I said. He groaned. "They seem to get all the
      best words," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall always feel, to my regret; that I am personally responsible for
      the outbreak of the present war. It may have had ulterior causes. But
      there is no doubt that it was precipitated by the fact that, for the first
      time in seventeen years, I took a six weeks' vacation in June and July of
      1914. The consequences of this careless step I ought to have foreseen. Yet
      I took such precautions as I could. "Do you think," I asked, "that you can
      preserve the <i>status quo</i> for six weeks, merely six weeks, if I stop
      spying and take a rest?" "We'll try," they answered. "Remember," I said,
      as I packed my things, "keep the Dardanelles closed; have the Sandjak of
      Novi Bazaar properly patrolled, and let the Dobrudja remain under a <i>modus
      vivendi</i> till I come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months later, while sitting sipping my coffee at a Kurhof in the
      Schwarzwald, I read in the newspapers that a German army had invaded
      France and was fighting the French, and that the English expeditionary
      force had crossed the Channel. "This," I said to myself, "means war." As
      usual, I was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless for me to recount here the life of busy activity that falls
      to a Spy in wartime. It was necessary for me to be here, there and
      everywhere, visiting all the best hotels, watering-places, summer resorts,
      theatres, and places of amusement. It was necessary, moreover, to act with
      the utmost caution and to assume an air of careless indolence in order to
      lull suspicion asleep. With this end in view I made a practice of never
      rising till ten in the morning. I breakfasted with great leisure, and
      contented myself with passing the morning in a quiet stroll, taking care,
      however, to keep my ears open. After lunch I generally feigned a light
      sleep, keeping my ears shut. A <i>table d'hote</i> dinner, followed by a
      visit to the theatre, brought the strenuous day to a close. Few Spies, I
      venture to say, worked harder than I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the third year of the war that I received a peremptory
      summons from the head of the Imperial Secret Service at Berlin, Baron
      Fisch von Gestern. "I want to see you," it read. Nothing more. In the life
      of a Spy one learns to think quickly, and to think is to act. I gathered
      as soon as I received the despatch that for some reason or other Fisch von
      Gestern was anxious to see me, having, as I instantly inferred, something
      to say to me. This conjecture proved correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron rose at my entrance with military correctness and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you willing," he inquired, "to undertake a mission to America?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. How soon can you start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as I have paid the few bills that I owe in Berlin," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can hardly wait for that," said my chief, "and in case it might excite
      comment. You must start to-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such," said the Baron, "are the Kaiser's orders. Here is an American
      passport and a photograph that will answer the purpose. The likeness is
      not great, but it is sufficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," I objected, abashed for a moment, "this photograph is of a man with
      whiskers and I am, unfortunately, clean-shaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The orders are imperative," said Gestern, with official hauteur. "You
      must start to-night. You can grow whiskers this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now to the business of your mission," continued the Baron. "The
      United States, as you have perhaps heard, is making war against Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard so," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued Gestern. "The fact has leaked out&mdash;how, we do not
      know&mdash;and is being widely reported. His Imperial Majesty has decided
      to stop the war with the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He intends to send over a secret treaty of the same nature as the one
      recently made with his recent Highness the recent Czar of Russia. Under
      this treaty Germany proposes to give to the United States the whole of
      equatorial Africa and in return the United States is to give to Germany
      the whole of China. There are other provisions, but I need not trouble you
      with them. Your mission relates, not to the actual treaty, but to the
      preparation of the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are aware, I presume," continued the Baron, "that in all high
      international dealings, at least in Europe, the ground has to be prepared.
      A hundred threads must be unravelled. This the Imperial Government itself
      cannot stoop to do. The work must be done by agents like yourself. You
      understand all this already, no doubt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I indicated my assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These, then, are your instructions," said the Baron, speaking slowly and
      distinctly, as if to impress his words upon my memory. "On your arrival in
      the United States you will follow the accredited methods that are known to
      be used by all the best Spies of the highest diplomacy. You have no doubt
      read some of the books, almost manuals of instruction, that they have
      written?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read many of them," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. You will enter, that is to say, enter and move everywhere in
      the best society. Mark specially, please, that you must not only <i>enter</i>
      it but you must <i>move</i>. You must, if I may put it so, get a move on."
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must mix freely with the members of the Cabinet. You must dine with
      them. This is a most necessary matter and one to be kept well in mind.
      Dine with them often in such a way as to make yourself familiar to them.
      Will you do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. Remember also that in order to mask your purpose you must
      constantly be seen with the most fashionable and most beautiful women of
      the American capital. Can you do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must if need be"&mdash;and the Baron gave a most significant look
      which was not lost upon me&mdash;"carry on an intrigue with one or,
      better, with several of them. Are you ready for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than ready," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. But this is only a part. You are expected also to familiarize
      yourself with the leaders of the great financial interests. You are to put
      yourself on such a footing with them as to borrow large sums of money from
      them. Do you object to this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I said frankly, "I do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! You will also mingle freely in Ambassadorial and foreign circles.
      It would be well for you to dine, at least once a week, with the British
      Ambassador. And now one final word"&mdash;here Gestern spoke with singular
      impressiveness&mdash;"as to the President of the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must mix with him on a footing of the most open-handed friendliness.
      Be at the White House continually. Make yourself in the fullest sense of
      the words the friend and adviser of the President. All this I think is
      clear. In fact, it is only what is done, as you know, by all the masters
      of international diplomacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. And then," continued the Baron, "as soon as you find yourself
      sufficiently <i>en rapport</i> with everybody, or I should say," he added
      in correction, for the Baron shares fully in the present German horror of
      imported French words, "when you find yourself sufficiently in
      enggeknupfterverwandtschaft with everybody, you may then proceed to
      advance your peace terms. And now, my dear fellow," said the Baron, with a
      touch of genuine cordiality, "one word more. Are you in need of money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so. But you will find that you need it less and less as you go
      on. Meantime, good-bye, and best wishes for your mission."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was, such is, in fact, the mission with which I am accredited. I
      regard it as by far the most important mission with which I have been
      accredited by the Wilhelmstrasse. Yet I am compelled to admit that up to
      the present it has proved unsuccessful. My attempts to carry it out have
      been baffled. There is something perhaps in the atmosphere of this
      republic which obstructs the working of high diplomacy. For over five
      months now I have been waiting and willing to dine with the American
      Cabinet. They have not invited me. For four weeks I sat each night waiting
      in the J. hotel in Washington with my suit on ready to be asked. They did
      not come near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor have I yet received an invitation from the British Embassy inviting me
      to an informal lunch or to midnight supper with the Ambassador. Everybody
      who knows anything of the inside working of the international spy system
      will realize that without these invitations one can do nothing. Nor has
      the President of the United States given any sign. I have sent ward to
      him, in cipher, that I am ready to dine with him on any day that may be
      convenient to both of us. He has made no move in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances an intrigue with any of the leaders of
      fashionable society has proved impossible. My attempts to approach them
      have been misunderstood&mdash;in fact, have led to my being invited to
      leave the J. hotel. The fact that I was compelled to leave it, owing to
      reasons that I cannot reveal, without paying my account, has occasioned
      unnecessary and dangerous comment. I connect it, in fact, with the
      singular attitude adopted by the B. hotel on my arrival in New York, to
      which I have already referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have therefore been compelled to fall back on revelations and
      disclosures. Here again I find the American atmosphere singularly
      uncongenial. I have offered to reveal to the Secretary of State the entire
      family history of Ferdinand of Bulgaria for fifty dollars. He says it is
      not worth it. I have offered to the British Embassy the inside story of
      the Abdication of Constantine for five dollars. They say they know it, and
      knew it before it happened. I have offered, for little more than a nominal
      sum, to blacken the character of every reigning family in Germany. I am
      told that it is not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, as it is impossible to return to Central Europe, I expect to
      open either a fruit store or a peanut stand very shortly in this great
      metropolis. I imagine that many of my former colleagues will soon be doing
      the same!

    <h2>
      II. Father Knickerbocker: A Fantasy
    </h2>
    <p>
      It happened quite recently&mdash;I think it must have been on April the
      second of 1917&mdash;that I was making the long pilgrimage on a day-train
      from the remote place where I dwell to the city of New York. And as we
      drew near the city, and day darkened into night, I had fallen to reading
      from a quaint old copy of Washington Irving's immortal sketches of Father
      Knickerbocker and of the little town where once he dwelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had picked up the book I know not where. Very old it apparently was and
      made in England. For there was pasted across the fly-leaf of it an extract
      from some ancient magazine or journal of a century ago, giving what was
      evidently a description of the New York of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      From reading the book I turned&mdash;my head still filled with the vision
      of Father Knickerbocker and Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown&mdash;to examine
      the extract. I read it in a sort of half-doze, for the dark had fallen
      outside, and the drowsy throbbing of the running train attuned one's mind
      to dreaming of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The town of New York"&mdash;so ran the extract pasted in the little book&mdash;"is
      pleasantly situated at the lower extremity of the Island of Manhattan. Its
      recent progress has been so amazing that it is now reputed, on good
      authority, to harbour at least twenty thousand souls. Viewed from the sea,
      it presents, even at the distance of half a mile, a striking appearance
      owing to the number and beauty of its church spires, which rise high above
      the roofs and foliage and give to the place its characteristically
      religious aspect. The extreme end of the island is heavily fortified with
      cannon, commanding a range of a quarter of a mile, and forbidding all
      access to the harbour. Behind this Battery a neat greensward affords a
      pleasant promenade, where the citizens are accustomed to walk with their
      wives every morning after church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I should like to have seen it!" I murmured to myself as I laid the
      book aside for a moment. "The Battery, the harbour and the citizens
      walking with their wives, their own wives, on the greensward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the town itself a wide thoroughfare, the Albany Post Road, runs
      meandering northward through the fields. It is known for some distance
      under the name of the Broad Way, and is so wide that four moving vehicles
      are said to be able to pass abreast. The Broad Way, especially in the
      springtime when it is redolent with the scent of clover and
      apple-blossoms, is a favourite evening promenade for the citizens&mdash;with
      their wives&mdash;after church. Here they may be seen any evening
      strolling toward the high ground overlooking the Hudson, their wives on
      one arm, a spyglass under the other, in order to view what they can see.
      Down the Broad Way may be seen moving also droves of young lambs with
      their shepherds, proceeding to the market, while here and there a goat
      stands quietly munching beside the road and gazing at the passers-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems," I muttered to myself as I read, "in some ways but little
      changed after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The town"&mdash;so the extract continued&mdash;"is not without its
      amusements. A commodious theatre presents with great success every
      Saturday night the plays of Shakespeare alternating with sacred concerts;
      the New Yorker, indeed, is celebrated throughout the provinces for his
      love of amusement and late hours. The theatres do not come out until long
      after nine o'clock, while for the gayer habitues two excellent restaurants
      serve fish, macaroni, prunes and other delicacies till long past ten at
      night. The dress of the New Yorker is correspondingly gay. In the other
      provinces the men wear nothing but plain suits of a rusty black, whereas
      in New York there are frequently seen suits of brown, snuff-colour and
      even of pepper-and-salt. The costumes of the New York women are equally
      daring, and differ notably from the quiet dress of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fine, it is commonly said in the provinces that a New Yorker can be
      recognized anywhere, with his wife, by their modish costumes, their easy
      manners and their willingness to spend money&mdash;two, three and even
      five cents being paid for the smallest service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," I thought, as I paused a moment in my reading, "so they had
      begun it even then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole spirit of the place"&mdash;the account continued&mdash;"has
      recently been admirably embodied in literary form by an American writer,
      Mr. Washington Irving (not to be confounded with George Washington). His
      creation of Father Knickerbocker is so lifelike that it may be said to
      embody the very spirit of New York. The accompanying woodcut&mdash;which
      was drawn on wood especially for this periodical&mdash;recalls at once the
      delightful figure of Father Knickerbocker. The New Yorkers of to-day are
      accustomed, indeed, to laugh at Mr. Irving's fancy and to say that
      Knickerbocker belongs to a day long since past. Yet those who know tell us
      that the image of the amiable old gentleman, kindly but irascible,
      generous and yet frugal, loving his town and seeing little beyond it, may
      be held once and for all to typify the spirit of the place, without
      reference to any particular time or generation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father Knickerbocker!" I murmured, as I felt myself dozing off to sleep,
      rocked by the motion of the car. "Father Knickerbocker, how strange if he
      could be here again and see the great city as we know it now! How
      different from his day! How I should love to go round New York and show it
      to him as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      So I mused and dozed till the very rumble of the wheels seemed to piece
      together in little snatches. "Father Knickerbocker&mdash;Father
      Knickerbocker&mdash;the Battery&mdash;the Battery&mdash;citizens walking
      with their wives, with their wives&mdash;their own wives"&mdash;until
      presently, I imagine, I must have fallen asleep altogether and knew no
      more till my journey was over and I found myself among the roar and bustle
      of the concourse of the Grand Central.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, lo and behold, waiting to meet me, was Father Knickerbocker
      himself! I know not how it happened, by what queer freak of hallucination
      or by what actual miracle&mdash;let those explain it who deal in such
      things&mdash;but there he stood before me, with an outstretched hand and a
      smile of greeting, Father Knickerbocker himself, the Embodied Spirit of
      New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange," I said. "I was just reading about you in a book on the
      train and imagining how much I should like actually to meet you and to
      show you round New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man laughed in a jaunty way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show <i>me</i> round?" he said. "Why, my dear boy, <i>I live here</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you did long ago," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do still," said Father Knickerbocker. "I've never left the place. I'll
      show <i>you</i> around. But wait a bit&mdash;don't carry that handbag.
      I'll get a boy to call a porter to fetch a man to take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can carry it," I said. "It's a mere nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," said Father Knickerbocker, a little testily I thought,
      "I'm as democratic and as plain and simple as any man in this city. But
      when it comes to carrying a handbag in full sight of all this crowd, why,
      as I said to Peter Stuyvesant about&mdash;about"&mdash;here a misty look
      seemed to come over the old gentleman's face&mdash;"about two hundred
      years ago, I'll be hanged if I will. It can't be done. It's not up to
      date."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was saying this, Father Knickerbocker had beckoned to a group of
      porters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this gentleman's handbag," he said, "and you carry his newspapers,
      and you take his umbrella. Here's a quarter for you and a quarter for you
      and a quarter for you. One of you go in front and lead the way to a taxi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know the way yourself?" I asked in a half-whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do, but I generally like to walk with a boy in front of me.
      We all do. Only the cheap people nowadays find their own way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Knickerbocker had taken my arm and was walking along in a queer,
      excited fashion, senile and yet with a sort of forced youthfulness in his
      gait and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," he said, "get into this taxi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we <i>walk</i>?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible," said the old gentleman. "It's five blocks to where we are
      going."
    </p>
    <p>
      As we took our seats I looked again at my companion; this time more
      closely. Father Knickerbocker he certainly was, yet somehow strangely
      transformed from my pictured fancy of the Sleepy Hollow days. His antique
      coat with its wide skirt had, it seemed, assumed a modish cut as if in
      imitation of the bell-shaped spring overcoat of the young man about town.
      His three-cornered hat was set at a rakish angle till it looked almost
      like an up-to-date fedora. The great stick that he used to carry had
      somehow changed itself into the curved walking-stick of a Broadway
      lounger. The solid old shoes with their wide buckles were gone. In their
      place he wore narrow slippers of patent leather of which he seemed
      inordinately proud, for he had stuck his feet up ostentatiously on the
      seat opposite. His eyes followed my glance toward his shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the fox-trot," he said. "The old ones were no good. Have a cigarette?
      These are Armenian, or would you prefer a Honolulan or a Nigerian? Now,"
      he resumed, when we had lighted our cigarettes, "what would you like to do
      first? Dance the tango? Hear some Hawaiian music, drink cocktails, or
      what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what I should like most of all, Father Knickerbocker&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a devilish fine woman! Look, the tall blonde one! Give me blondes
      every time!" Here he smacked his lips. "By gad, sir, the women in this
      town seem to get finer every century. What were you saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Father Knickerbocker," I began, but he interrupted me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," he said. "May I ask you not to call me <i>Father</i>
      Knickerbocker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you were so old," I said humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old! Me <i>old</i>! Oh, I don't know. Why, dash it, there are plenty of
      men as old as I am dancing the tango here every night. Pray call me, if
      you don't mind, just Knickerbocker, or simply Knicky&mdash;most of the
      other boys call me Knicky. Now what's it to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of all," I said, "I should like to go to some quiet place and have a
      talk about the old days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," he said. "We're going to just the place now&mdash;nice quiet
      dinner, a good quiet orchestra, Hawaiian, but quiet, and lots of women."
      Here he smacked his lips again, and nudged me with his elbow. "Lots of
      women, bunches of them. Do you like women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. Knickerbocker," I said hesitatingly, "I suppose&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sniggered as he poked me again in the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet you do, you dog!" he chuckled. "We <i>all</i> do. For me, I
      confess it, sir, I can't sit down to dinner without plenty of women,
      stacks of them, all round me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the taxi had stopped. I was about to open the door and get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, wait," said Father Knickerbocker, his hand upon my arm, as he
      looked out of the window. "I'll see somebody in a minute who'll let us out
      for fifty cents. None of us here ever gets in or out of anything by
      ourselves. It's bad form. Ah, here he is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later we had passed through the portals of a great restaurant,
      and found ourselves surrounded with all the colour and tumult of a New
      York dinner <i>a la mode</i>. A burst of wild music, pounded and thrummed
      out on ukuleles by a group of yellow men in Hawaiian costume, filled the
      room, helping to drown or perhaps only serving to accentuate the babel of
      talk and the clatter of dishes that arose on every side. Men in evening
      dress and women in all the colours of the rainbow, <i>decollete</i> to a
      degree, were seated at little tables, blowing blue smoke into the air, and
      drinking green and yellow drinks from glasses with thin stems. A troupe of
      <i>cabaret</i> performers shouted and leaped on a little stage at the side
      of the room, unheeded by the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha ha!" said Knickerbocker, as we drew in our chairs to a table. "Some
      place, eh? There's a peach! Look at her! Or do you like better that
      lazy-looking brunette next to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knickerbocker was staring about the room, gazing at the women with
      open effrontery, and a senile leer upon his face. I felt ashamed of him.
      Yet, oddly enough, no one about us seemed in the least disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what cocktail will you have?" said my companion. "There's a new one
      this week, the Fantan, fifty cents each, will you have that? Right? Two
      Fantans. Now to eat&mdash;what would you like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have a slice of cold beef and a pint of ale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beef!" said Knickerbocker contemptuously. "My dear fellow, you can't have
      that. Beef is only fifty cents. Do take something reasonable. Try Lobster
      Newburg, or no, here's a more expensive thing&mdash;Filet Bourbon a la
      something. I don't know what it is, but by gad, sir, it's three dollars a
      portion anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," I said. "You order the dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Knickerbocker proceeded to do so, the head-waiter obsequiously at his
      side, and his long finger indicating on the menu everything that seemed
      most expensive and that carried the most incomprehensible name. When he
      had finished he turned to me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," he said, "let's talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," I said, "about the old days and the old times on Broadway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes," he answered, "the old days&mdash;you mean ten years ago before
      the Winter Garden was opened. We've been going ahead, sir, going ahead.
      Why, ten years ago there was practically nothing, sir, above Times Square,
      and look at it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to realize that Father Knickerbocker, old as he was, had forgotten
      all the earlier times with which I associated his memory. There was
      nothing left but the <i>cabarets</i>, and the Gardens, the Palm Rooms, and
      the ukuleles of to-day. Behind that his mind refused to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you remember," I asked, "the apple orchards and the quiet groves of
      trees that used to line Broadway long ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Groves!" he said. "I'll show you a grove, a coconut grove"&mdash;here he
      winked over his wineglass in a senile fashion&mdash;"that has apple-trees
      beaten from here to Honolulu." Thus he babbled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through our meal his talk continued: of <i>cabarets</i> and dances, or
      fox-trots and midnight suppers, of blondes and brunettes, "peaches" and
      "dreams," and all the while his eye roved incessantly among the tables,
      resting on the women with a bold stare. At times he would indicate and
      point out for me some of what he called the "representative people"
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notice that man at the second table," he would whisper across to me.
      "He's worth all the way to ten millions: made it in Government contracts;
      they tried to send him to the penitentiary last fall but they can't get
      him&mdash;he's too smart for them! I'll introduce you to him presently.
      See the man with him? That's his lawyer, biggest crook in America, they
      say; we'll meet him after dinner." Then he would suddenly break off and
      exclaim: "Egad, sir, there's a fine bunch of them," as another bevy of
      girls came trooping out upon the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," I murmured, "if there is nothing left of him but this? Has all
      the fine old spirit gone? Is it all drowned out in wine and suffocated in
      the foul atmosphere of luxury?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly I looked up at my companion, and I saw to my surprise that
      his whole face and manner had altered. His hand was clenched tight on the
      edge of the table. His eyes looked before him&mdash;through and beyond the
      riotous crowd all about him&mdash;into vacancy, into the far past, back
      into memories that I thought forgotten. His face had altered. The senile,
      leering look was gone, and in its place the firm-set face of the
      Knickerbocker of a century ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking in a strange voice, deep and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen," he said, "listen. Do you hear it&mdash;there&mdash;far out at
      sea&mdash;ships' guns&mdash;listen&mdash;they're calling for help&mdash;ships'
      guns&mdash;far out at sea!" He had clasped me by the arm. "Quick, to the
      Battery, they'll need every man to-night, they'll&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sank back into his chair. His look changed again. The vision died
      out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was I saying?" he asked. "Ah, yes, this old brandy, a very special
      brand. They keep it for me here, a dollar a glass. They know me here," he
      added in his fatuous way. "All the waiters know me. The headwaiter always
      knows me the minute I come into the room&mdash;keeps a chair for me. Now
      try this brandy and then presently we'll move on and see what's doing at
      some of the shows."
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow, in spite of himself, my companion seemed to be unable to
      bring himself fully back into the consciousness of the scene before him.
      The far-away look still lingered in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he turned and spoke to me in a low, confidential tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I talking to myself a moment ago?" he asked. "Yes? Ah, I feared I
      was. Do you know&mdash;I don't mind telling it to you&mdash;lately I've
      had a strange, queer feeling that comes over me at times, as if <i>something
      were happening</i>&mdash;something, I don't know what. I suppose," he
      continued, with a false attempt at resuming his fatuous manner, "I'm going
      the pace a little too hard, eh! Makes one fanciful. But the fact is, at
      times"&mdash;he spoke gravely again&mdash;"I feel as if there were
      something happening, something coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knickerbocker," I said earnestly, "Father Knickerbocker, don't you know
      that something <i>is</i> happening, that this very evening as we are
      sitting here in all this riot, the President of the United States is to
      come before Congress on the most solemn mission that ever&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But my speech fell unheeded. Knickerbocker had picked up his glass again
      and was leering over it at a bevy of girls dancing upon the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that girl," he interrupted quickly, "the one dancing at the end.
      What do you think of her, eh? Some peach!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Knickerbocker broke off suddenly. For at this moment our ears caught the
      sound of a noise, a distant tumult, as it were, far down the street and
      growing nearer. The old man had drawn himself erect in his seat, his hand
      to his ear, listening as he caught the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out on the Broad Way," he said, instinctively calling it by its ancient
      name as if a flood of memories were upon him. "Do you hear it? Listen&mdash;listen&mdash;what
      is it? I've heard that sound before&mdash;I've heard every sound on the
      Broad Way these two centuries back&mdash;what is it? I seem to know it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound and tumult as of running feet and of many voices crying came
      louder from the street. The people at the tables had turned in their seats
      to listen. The music of the orchestra had stopped. The waiters had thrown
      back the heavy curtains from the windows and the people were crowding to
      them to look out into the street. Knickerbocker had risen in his place,
      his eyes looked toward the windows, but his gaze was fixed on vacancy as
      with one who sees a vision passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the sound," he cried. "I see it all again. Look, can't you see
      them? It's Massachusetts soldiers marching South to the war&mdash;can't
      you hear the beating of the drums and the shrill calling of the fife&mdash;the
      regiments from the North, the first to come. I saw them pass, here where
      we are sitting, sixty years ago&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Knickerbocker paused a moment, his hand still extended in the air, and
      then with a great light upon his face he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it now! I know what it meant, the feeling that has haunted me&mdash;the
      sounds I kept hearing&mdash;the guns of the ships at sea and the voices
      calling in distress! I know now. It means, sir, it means&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he spoke a great cry came up from the street and burst in at the
      doors and windows, echoing in a single word:
    </p>
    <p>
      WAR! WAR! The message of the President is for WAR!
    </p>
    <p>
      "War!" cried Father Knickerbocker, rising to his full height, stern and
      majestic and shouting in a stentorian tone that echoed through the great
      room. "War! War! To your places, every one of you! Be done with your idle
      luxury! Out with the glare of your lights! Begone you painted women and
      worthless men! To your places every man of you! To the Battery! Man the
      guns! Stand to it, every one of you for the defence of America&mdash;for
      our New York, New York&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the sound "New York, New York" still echoing in my ears I woke
      up. The vision of my dream was gone. I was still on the seat of the car
      where I had dozed asleep, the book upon my knee. The train had arrived at
      the depot and the porters were calling into the doorway of the car: "New
      York! New York!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All about me was the stir and hubbub of the great depot. But loud over all
      it was heard the call of the newsboys crying "WAR! WAR! The President's
      message is for WAR! Late extra! WAR! WAR!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And I knew that a great nation had cast aside the bonds of sloth and
      luxury, and was girding itself to join in the fight for the free democracy
      of all mankind.

    <h2>
      III. The Prophet in Our Midst
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Eminent Authority looked around at the little group of us seated about
      him at the club. He was telling us, or beginning to tell us, about the
      outcome of the war. It was a thing we wanted to know. We were listening
      attentively. We felt that we were "getting something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt very much," he said, "whether Downing Street realizes the
      enormous power which the Quai d'Orsay has over the Yildiz Kiosk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," I said, "what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he hardly noticed the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to remember," he went on, "that, from the point of view of the
      Yildiz, the Wilhelmstrasse is just a thing of yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," he added, "the Ballplatz is quite different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Altogether different," I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mind you," he said, "the Ballplatz itself can be largely moved from
      the Quirinal through the Vatican."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why of course it can," I agreed, with as much relief in my tone as I
      could put into it. After all, what simpler way of moving the Ballplatz
      than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eminent Authority took another sip at his tea, and looked round at us
      through his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I who was taking on myself to do most of the answering, because it
      was I who had brought him there and invited the other men to meet him.
      "He's coming round at five," I had said, "do come and have a cup of tea
      and meet him. He knows more about the European situation and the probable
      solution than any other man living." Naturally they came gladly. They
      wanted to know&mdash;as everybody wants to know&mdash;how the war will
      end. They were just ordinary plain men like myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see that they were a little mystified, perhaps disappointed. They
      would have liked, just as I would, to ask a few plain questions, such as,
      can the Italians knock the stuff out of the Austrians? Are the Rumanians
      getting licked or not? How many submarines has Germany got, anyway? Such
      questions, in fact, as we are accustomed to put up to one another every
      day at lunch and to answer out of the morning paper. As it was, we didn't
      seem to be getting anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke. The silence began to be even a little uncomfortable. It was
      broken by my friend Rapley, who is in wholesale hardware and who has all
      the intellectual bravery that goes with it. He asked the Authority
      straight out the question that we all wanted to put.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what do you mean by the Ballplatz? What is the Ballplatz?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Authority smiled an engaging smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," he said, "I see your drift exactly. You say what <i>is</i>
      the Ballplatz? I reply quite frankly that it is almost impossible to
      answer. Probably one could best define it as the driving power behind the
      Ausgleich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Rapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though the plain fact is that ever since the Herzegovinian embroglio the
      Ballplatz is little more than a counterpoise to the Wilhelmstrasse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Rapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, as everybody knows, the whole relationship of the Ballplatz with
      the Nevski Prospekt has emanated from the Wilhelmstrasse."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a thing which personally I had <i>not</i> known. But I said
      nothing. Neither did the other men. They continued smoking, looking as
      innocent as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't misunderstand me," said the Authority, "when I speak of the Nevski
      Prospekt. I am not referring in any way to the Tsarskoe Selo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," we all agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt there were, as we see it plainly now, under currents in all
      directions from the Tsarskoe Selo."
    </p>
    <p>
      We all seemed to suggest by our attitude that these undercurrents were
      sucking at our very feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Tsarskoe Selo," said the Authority, "is now definitely
      eliminated."
    </p>
    <p>
      We were glad of that; we shifted our feet back into attitudes of ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that it was time to ask a leading question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think," I said, "that Germany will be broken up by the war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Germany in what sense? Are you thinking of Preuszenthum? Are you
      referring to Junkerismus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I said, quite truthfully, "neither of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the Authority, "I see; you mean Germany as a Souverantat
      embodied in a Reichsland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's rather hard," said the Eminent Authority, "to answer your
      question in plain terms. But I'll try. One thing, of course, is <i>absolutely</i>
      certain, Mittel-Europa goes overboard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, absolutely. This is the end of Mittel-Europa. I mean to say&mdash;here
      we've had Mittel-Europa, that is, the Mittel-Europa <i>idea</i>, as a sort
      of fantasmus in front of Teutonism ever since Koniggratz."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Authority looked all round us in that searching way he had. We all
      tried to look like men seeing a fantasmus and disgusted at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see," he went on, "Mittel-Europa is done with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it is," I said. I didn't know just whether to speak with regret
      or not. I heard Rapley murmur, "I guess so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is not a doubt," continued the Authority, "that when
      Mittel-Europa goes, Grossdeutschthum goes with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sure to," we all murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, there you are&mdash;what is the result for Germany&mdash;why
      the thing's as plain as a pikestaff&mdash;in fact you're driven to it by
      the sheer logic of the situation&mdash;there is only <i>one</i> outcome&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Authority was speaking very deliberately. He even paused at this point
      and lighted a cigarette, while we all listened breathlessly. We felt that
      we had got the thing to a focus at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only one outcome&mdash;a Staatenbund."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great heavens," I said, "not a Staatenbund!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," said the Authority, puffing quietly at his cigarette, as if
      personally he wouldn't lift a finger to stop the Staatenbund if he could,
      "that's the end of it, a Staatenbund. In other words, we are back where we
      were before the Vienna Congress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he chuckled heartily to himself: so the rest of us laughed too:
      the thing was <i>too</i> absurd. But the Authority, who was a man of nice
      distinctions and genuinely anxious to instruct us, was evidently afraid
      that he had overstated things a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind you," he said, "there'll be <i>something</i> left&mdash;certainly
      the Zollverein and either the Ausgleich or something very like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the men gave a sort of sigh of relief. It was certainly something
      to have at least a sort of resemblance or appearance of the Ausgleich
      among us. We felt that we were getting on. One could see that a number of
      the men were on the brink of asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Rumania," asked Nelles&mdash;he is a banker and interested in
      government bonds&mdash;"is this the end of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the Authority, "it's not the end of Rumania, but it <i>is</i>
      the end of Rumanian Irridentismus."
    </p>
    <p>
      That settled Nelles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the Turks?" asked Rapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Turks, or rather, I suppose it would be more proper to say, the
      Osmanli, as that is no doubt what you mean?" Rapley nodded. "Well,
      speaking personally, I should say that there's no difficulty in a
      permanent settlement in that quarter. If I were drawing up the terms of a
      treaty of peace meant to be really lasting I should lay down three
      absolute bases; the rest needn't matter"&mdash;the Authority paused a
      moment and then proceeded to count off the three conditions of peace on
      his fingers&mdash;"These would be, first, the evacuation of the Sandjak;
      second, an international guarantee for the Capitulations; and third, for
      internal matters, an arrangement along the lines of the original firman of
      Midhat Pasha."
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of complete satisfaction went round the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say," continued the Eminent Authority, "that there wouldn't be
      other minor matters to adjust; but they would be a mere detail. You ask
      me, for instance, for a <i>milice</i>, or at least a gendarmerie, in the
      Albanian hinterland; very good, I grant it you at once. You retain, if you
      like, you abolish the Cypriotic suzerainty of the Porte&mdash;all right.
      These are matters of indifference."
    </p>
    <p>
      We all assumed a look of utter indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the Dardanelles? Would you have them fixed so that ships
      could go through, or not?" asked Rapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a plain man, not easily put down and liking a plain answer. He got
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Dardanelles," said the Authority, "could easily be denationalized
      under a quadrilateral guarantee to be made a pars materia of the pactum
      foederis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That ought to hold them," I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Authority felt now that he had pretty well settled the map of Europe.
      He rose and shook hands with us all around very cordially. We did not try
      to detain him. We felt that time like his was too valuable to be wasted on
      things like us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I tell you," said Rapley, as we settled back into our chairs when
      the Great Authority had gone, "my own opinion, boys, is that the United
      States and England can trim Germany and Austria any day in the week and
      twice on Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      After which somebody else said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder how many of these submarines Germany has, anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we drifted back into the humbler kind of war talk that we have
      been carrying on for three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But later, as we walked home together, Rapley said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fellow threw a lot of light on things in Europe, didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And I answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      What liars we all are!

    <h2>
      IV. Personal Adventures in the Spirit World
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not write what follows with the expectation of convincing or
      converting anybody. We Spiritualists, or Spiritists&mdash;we call
      ourselves both, or either&mdash;never ask anybody to believe us. If they
      do, well and good. If not, all right. Our attitude simply is that facts
      are facts. There they are; believe them or not as you like. As I said the
      other night, in conversation with Aristotle and John Bunyan and George
      Washington and a few others, why should anybody believe us? Aristotle, I
      recollect, said that all that he wished was that everybody should know how
      happy he was; and Washington said that for his part, if people only knew
      how bright and beautiful it all was where he was, they would willingly,
      indeed gladly, pay the mere dollar&mdash;itself only a nominal fee&mdash;that
      it cost to talk to him. Bunyan, I remember, added that he himself was
      quite happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as I say, I never ask anybody to believe me; the more so as I was
      once an absolute sceptic myself. As I see it now, I was prejudiced. The
      mere fact that spiritual seances and the services of a medium involved the
      payment of money condemned the whole thing in my eyes. I did not realize,
      as I do now, that these <i>medii</i>, like anybody else, have got to live;
      otherwise they would die and become spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor would I now place these disclosures before the public eyes were if not
      that I think that in the present crisis they will prove of value to the
      Allied cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let me begin at the beginning. My own conversion to spiritualism came
      about, like that of so many others, through the more or less casual remark
      of a Friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noticing me one day gloomy and depressed, this Friend remarked to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any belief in Spiritualism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it come from anyone else, I should have turned the question aside with
      a sneer. But it so happens that I owe a great deal of gratitude to this
      particular Friend. It was he who, at a time when I was so afflicted with
      rheumatism that I could scarcely leap five feet into the air without pain,
      said to me one day quite casually: "Have you ever tried pyro for your
      rheumatism?" One month later I could leap ten feet in the air&mdash;had I
      been able to&mdash;without the slightest malaise. The same man, I may add,
      hearing me one day exclaiming to myself: "Oh, if there were anything that
      would remove the stains from my clothes!" said to me very simply and
      quietly: "Have you ever washed them in luxo?" It was he, too, who,
      noticing a haggard look on my face after breakfast one morning, inquired
      immediately what I had been eating for breakfast; after which, with a
      simplicity and directness which I shall never forget, he said: "Why not
      eat humpo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor can I ever forget my feeling on another occasion when, hearing me
      exclaim aloud: "Oh, if there were only something invented for removing the
      proteins and amygdaloids from a carbonized diet and leaving only the pure
      nitrogenous life-giving elements!" seized my hand in his, and said in a
      voice thrilled with emotion: "There is! It has!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will understand, therefore, that a question, or query, from
      such a Friend was not to be put lightly aside. When he asked if I believed
      in Spiritualism I answered with perfect courtesy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be quite frank, I do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between us for a time, and then my Friend said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever given it a trial?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused a moment, as the idea was a novel one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I answered, "to be quite candid, I have not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of us spoke for perhaps twenty minutes after this, when my Friend
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything against it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought awhile and then I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      My Friend remained silent for perhaps half an hour. Then he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I meditated for some time. Then I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This&mdash;it seems to me that the whole thing is done for money. How
      utterly unnatural it is to call up the dead&mdash;one's great-grandfather,
      let us say&mdash;and pay money for talking to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," said my Friend without a moment's pause. "I thought so. Now
      suppose I could bring you into contact with the spirit world through a
      medium, or through different <i>medii</i>, without there being any
      question of money, other than a merely nominal fee, the money being, as it
      were, left out of count, and regarded as only, so to speak, nominal,
      something given merely <i>pro forma</i> and <i>ad interim</i>. Under these
      circumstances, will you try the experiment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose and took my Friend's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," I said, "I not only will, but I shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      From this conversation dated my connection with Spiritualism, which has
      since opened for me a new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be out of place for me to indicate the particular address or the
      particular methods employed by the agency to which my Friend introduced
      me. I am anxious to avoid anything approaching a commercial tinge in what
      I write. Moreover, their advertisement can be seen along with many others&mdash;all,
      I am sure, just as honourable and just as trustworthy&mdash;in the columns
      of any daily newspaper. As everybody knows, many methods are employed. The
      tapping of a table, the movement of a ouija board, or the voice of a
      trance medium, are only a few among the many devices by which the spirits
      now enter into communication with us. But in my own case the method used
      was not only simplicity itself, but was so framed as to carry with it the
      proof of its own genuineness. One had merely to speak into the receiver of
      a telephone, and the voice of the spirit was heard through the transmitter
      as in an ordinary telephone conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only natural, after the scoffing remark that I had made, that I
      should begin with my great-grandfather. Nor can I ever forget the peculiar
      thrill that went through me when I was informed by the head of the agency
      that a tracer was being sent out for Great-grandfather to call him to the
      phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great-grandfather&mdash;let me do him this justice&mdash;was prompt. He
      was there in three minutes. Whatever his line of business was in the
      spirit world&mdash;and I was never able to learn it&mdash;he must have
      left it immediately and hurried to the telephone. Whatever later
      dissatisfaction I may have had with Great-grandfather, let me state it
      fairly and honestly, he is at least a punctual man. Every time I called he
      came right away without delay. Let those who are inclined to cavil at the
      methods of the Spiritualists reflect how impossible it would be to secure
      such punctuality on anything but a basis of absolute honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my first conversation with Great-grandfather, I found myself so
      absurdly nervous at the thought of the vast gulf of space and time across
      which we were speaking that I perhaps framed my questions somewhat too
      crudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, great-grandfather?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice came back to me as distinctly as if he were in the next room:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am happy, very happy. Please tell everybody that I am <i>happy</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great-grandfather," I said. "I will. I'll see that everybody knows it.
      Where are you, great-grandfather?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," he answered, "beyond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here on the other side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Side of which?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the great vastness," he answered. "The other end of the Illimitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see," I said, "that's where you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      We were silent for some time. It is amazing how difficult it is to find
      things to talk about with one's great-grandfather. For the life of me I
      could think of nothing better than:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of weather have you been having?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no weather here," said Great-grandfather. "It's all bright and
      beautiful all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean bright sunshine?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no sun here," said Great-grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how do you mean&mdash;" I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment the head of the agency tapped me on the shoulder to
      remind me that the two minutes' conversation for which I had deposited, as
      a nominal fee, five dollars, had expired. The agency was courteous enough
      to inform me that for five dollars more Great-grandfather would talk
      another two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I thought it preferable to stop for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I do not wish to say a word against my own great-grandfather. Yet in
      the conversations which followed on successive days I found him&mdash;how
      shall I put it?&mdash;unsatisfactory. He had been, when on this side&mdash;to
      use the term we Spiritualists prefer&mdash;a singularly able man, an
      English judge; so at least I have always been given to understand. But
      somehow Great-grandfather's brain, on the other side, seemed to have got
      badly damaged. My own theory is that, living always in the bright
      sunshine, he had got sunstroke. But I may wrong him. Perhaps it was
      locomotor ataxy that he had. That he was very, very happy where he was is
      beyond all doubt. He said so at every conversation. But I have noticed
      that feeble-minded people are often happy. He said, too, that he was glad
      to be where he was; and on the whole I felt glad that he was too. Once or
      twice I thought that possibly Great-grandfather felt so happy because he
      had been drinking: his voice, even across the great gulf, seemed somehow
      to suggest it. But on being questioned he told me that where he was there
      was no drink and no thirst, because it was all so bright and beautiful. I
      asked him if he meant that it was "bone-dry" like Kansas, or whether the
      rich could still get it? But he didn't answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our intercourse ended in a quarrel. No doubt it was my fault. But it <i>did</i>
      seem to me that Great-grandfather, who had been one of the greatest
      English lawyers of his day, might have handed out an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter came up thus: I had had an argument&mdash;it was in the middle
      of last winter&mdash;with some men at my club about the legal
      interpretation of the Adamson Law. The dispute grew bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm right," I said, "and I'll prove it if you give me time to consult the
      authorities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consult your great-grandfather!" sneered one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," I said, "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked straight across the room to the telephone and called up the
      agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me my great-grandfather," I said. "I want him right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there. Good, punctual old soul, I'll say that for him. He was
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great-grandfather," I said, "I'm in a discussion here about the
      constitutionality of the Adamson Law, involving the power of Congress
      under the Constitution. Now, you remember the Constitution when they made
      it. Is the law all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does it stand, great-grandfather?" I said. "Will it hold water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over here," he said, "there are no laws, no members of Congress and no
      Adamsons; it's all bright and beautiful and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great-grandfather," I said, as I hung up the receiver in disgust, "you
      are a Mutt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I never spoke to him again. Yet I feel sorry for him, feeble old soul,
      flitting about in the Illimitable, and always so punctual to hurry to the
      telephone, so happy, so feeble-witted and courteous; a better man,
      perhaps, take it all in all, than he was in life; lonely, too, it may be,
      out there in the Vastness. Yet I never called him up again. He is happy.
      Let him stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, my acquaintance with the spirit world might have ended at that
      point but for the good offices, once more, of my Friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You find your great-grandfather a little slow, a little dull?" he said.
      "Well, then, if you want brains, power, energy, why not call up some of
      the spirits of the great men, some of the leading men, for instance, of
      your great-grandfather's time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've said it!" I exclaimed. "I'll call up Napoleon Bonaparte."
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried to the agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," I asked, "for me to call up the Emperor Napoleon and
      talk to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Possible? Certainly. It appeared that nothing was easier. In the case of
      Napoleon Bonaparte the nominal fee had to be ten dollars in place of five;
      but it seemed to me that, if Great-grandfather cost five, Napoleon
      Bonaparte at ten was cheapness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it take long to get him?" I asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll send out a tracer for him right away," they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Great-grandfather, Napoleon was punctual. That I will say for him. If
      in any way I think less of Napoleon Bonaparte now than I did, let me at
      least admit that a more punctual, obliging, willing man I never talked
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's on the line now," they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took up the receiver, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" I called. "Est-ce que c'est l'Empereur Napoleon a qui j'ai
      l'honneur de parler?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?" said Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Je demande si je suis en communication avec l'Empereur Napoleon&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Napoleon, "that's all right; speak English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" I said in surprise. "You know English? I always thought you
      couldn't speak a word of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a minute. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I picked it up over here. It's all right. Go right ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," I continued, "I've always admired you so much, your wonderful
      brain and genius, that I felt I wanted to speak to you and ask you how you
      are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy," said Napoleon, "very happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good," I said. "That's fine! And how is it out there? All bright
      and beautiful, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very beautiful," said the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And just where are you?" I continued. "Somewhere out in the Unspeakable,
      I suppose, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he answered, "out here beyond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good," I said. "Pretty happy, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very happy," said Napoleon. "Tell everybody how happy I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," I answered. "I'll tell them all. But just now I've a particular
      thing to ask. We've got a big war on, pretty well the whole world in it,
      and I thought perhaps a few pointers from a man like you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point the attendant touched me on the shoulder. "Your time is
      up," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to offer to pay at once for two minutes more when a better
      idea struck me. Talk with Napoleon? I'd do better than that. I'd call a
      whole War Council of great spirits, lay the war crisis before them and get
      the biggest brains that the world ever produced to work on how to win the
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who should I have? Let me see! Napoleon himself, of course. I'd bring him
      back. And for the sea business, the submarine problem, I'd have Nelson.
      George Washington, naturally, for the American end; for politics, say,
      good old Ben Franklin, the wisest old head that ever walked on American
      legs, and witty too; yes, Franklin certainly, if only for his wit to keep
      the council from getting gloomy; Lincoln&mdash;honest old Abe&mdash;him
      certainly I must have. Those and perhaps a few others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned that a consultation at ten dollars apiece with spirits of that
      class was cheap to the verge of the ludicrous. Their advice ought to be
      worth millions&mdash;yes, billions&mdash;to the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agency got them for me without trouble. There is no doubt they are a
      punctual crowd, over there beyond in the Unthinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered them all in and talked to them, all and severally, the payment,
      a merely nominal matter, being made, <i>pro forma</i>, in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have in front of me in my rough notes the result of their advice. When
      properly drafted it will be, I feel sure, one of the most important state
      documents produced in the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the personal sense&mdash;I have to admit it&mdash;I found them just a
      trifle disappointing. Franklin, poor fellow, has apparently lost his wit.
      The spirit of Lincoln seemed to me to have none of that homely wisdom that
      he used to have. And it appears that we were quite mistaken in thinking
      Disraeli a brilliant man; it is clear to me now that he was dull&mdash;just
      about as dull as Great-grandfather, I should say. Washington, too, is not
      at all the kind of man we thought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, these are only personal impressions. They detract nothing from the
      extraordinary value of the advice given, which seems to me to settle once
      and for ever any lingering doubt about the value of communications with
      the Other Side.
    </p>
    <p>
      My draft of their advice runs in part as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spirit of Nelson, on being questioned on the submarine problem, holds
      that if all the men on the submarines were where he is everything would be
      bright and happy. This seems to me an invaluable hint. There is nothing
      needed now except to put them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advice of the Spirit of Napoleon about the campaign on land seemed to
      me, if possible, of lower value than that of Nelson on the campaign at
      sea. It is hardly conceivable that Napoleon has forgotten where the Marne
      is. But it may have changed since his day. At any rate, he says that, if
      ever the Russians cross the Marne, all is over. Coming from such a
      master-strategist, this ought to be attended to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franklin, on being asked whether the United States had done right in going
      into the war, said "Yes"; asked whether the country could with honour have
      stayed out, he said "No." There is guidance here for thinking men of all
      ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln is very happy where he is. So, too, I was amazed to find, is
      Disraeli. In fact, it was most gratifying to learn that all of the great
      spirits consulted are very happy, and want everybody to know how happy
      they are. Where they are, I may say, it is all bright and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear of trespassing on their time prevented me from questioning each of
      them up to the full limit of the period contracted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that I have still to my credit at the agency five minutes'
      talk with Napoleon, available at any time, and similarly five minutes each
      with Franklin and Washington, to say nothing of ten minutes' unexpired
      time with Great-grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these opportunities I am willing to dispose of at a reduced rate to
      anyone still sceptical of the reality of the spirit world.

      V. The Sorrows of a Summer Guest
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let me admit, as I start to write, that the whole thing is my own fault. I
      should never have come. I knew better. I have known better for years. I
      have known that it is sheer madness to go and pay visits in other people's
      houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in a moment of insanity I have let myself in for it and here I am.
      There is no hope, no outlet now till the first of September when my visit
      is to terminate. Either that or death. I do not greatly care which.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write this, where no human eye can see me, down by the pond&mdash;they
      call it the lake&mdash;at the foot of Beverly-Jones's estate. It is six
      o'clock in the morning. No one is up. For a brief hour or so there is
      peace. But presently Miss Larkspur&mdash;the jolly English girl who
      arrived last week&mdash;will throw open her casement window and call
      across the lawn, "Hullo everybody! What a ripping morning!" And young
      Poppleson will call back in a Swiss yodel from somewhere in the shrubbery,
      and Beverly-Jones will appear on the piazza with big towels round his neck
      and shout, "Who's coming for an early dip?" And so the day's fun and
      jollity&mdash;heaven help me&mdash;will begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they will all come trooping in to breakfast, in coloured blazers
      and fancy blouses, laughing and grabbing at the food with mimic rudeness
      and bursts of hilarity. And to think that I might have been breakfasting
      at my club with the morning paper propped against the coffee-pot, in a
      silent room in the quiet of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat that it is my own fault that I am here.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years it had been a principle of my life to visit nobody. I had
      long since learned that visiting only brings misery. If I got a card or
      telegram that said, "Won't you run up to the Adirondacks and spend the
      week-end with us?" I sent back word: "No, not unless the Adirondacks can
      run faster than I can," or words to that effect. If the owner of a country
      house wrote to me: "Our man will meet you with a trap any afternoon that
      you care to name," I answered, in spirit at least: "No, he won't, not
      unless he has a bear-trap or one of those traps in which they catch wild
      antelope." If any fashionable lady friend wrote to me in the peculiar
      jargon that they use: "Can you give us from July the twelfth at
      half-after-three till the fourteenth at four?" I replied: "Madam, take the
      whole month, take a year, but leave me in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such at least was the spirit of my answers to invitations. In practice I
      used to find it sufficient to send a telegram that read: "Crushed with
      work impossible to get away," and then stroll back into the reading-room
      of the club and fall asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my coming here was my own fault. It resulted from one of those unhappy
      moments of expansiveness such as occur, I imagine, to everybody&mdash;moments
      when one appears to be something quite different from what one really is,
      when one feels oneself a thorough good fellow, sociable, merry,
      appreciative, and finds the people around one the same. Such moods are
      known to all of us. Some people say that it is the super-self asserting
      itself. Others say it is from drinking. But let it pass. That at any rate
      was the kind of mood that I was in when I met Beverly-Jones and when he
      asked me here.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the afternoon, at the club. As I recall it, we were drinking
      cocktails and I was thinking what a bright, genial fellow Beverly-Jones
      was, and how completely I had mistaken him. For myself&mdash;I admit it&mdash;I
      am a brighter, better man after drinking two cocktails than at any other
      time&mdash;quicker, kindlier, more genial. And higher, morally. I had been
      telling stories in that inimitable way that one has after two cocktails.
      In reality, I only know four stories, and a fifth that I don't quite
      remember, but in moments of expansiveness they feel like a fund or flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was under such circumstances that I sat with Beverly-Jones. And it was
      in shaking hands at leaving that he said: "I <i>do</i> wish, old chap,
      that you could run up to our summer place and give us the whole of
      August!" and I answered, as I shook him warmly by the hand: "My <i>dear</i>
      fellow, I'd simply <i>love</i> to!" "By gad, then it's a go!" he said.
      "You must come up for August, and wake us all up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wake them up! Ye gods! Me wake them up!
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour later I was repenting of my folly, and wishing, when I thought of
      the two cocktails, that the prohibition wave could be hurried up so as to
      leave us all high and dry&mdash;bone-dry, silent and unsociable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I clung to the hope that Beverly-Jones would forget. But no. In due
      time his wife wrote to me. They were looking forward so much, she said, to
      my visit; they felt&mdash;she repeated her husband's ominous phrase&mdash;that
      I should wake them all up!
    </p>
    <p>
      What sort of alarm-clock did they take me for, anyway!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, well! They know better now. It was only yesterday afternoon that
      Beverly-Jones found me standing here in the gloom of some cedar-trees
      beside the edge of the pond and took me back so quietly to the house that
      I realized he thought I meant to drown myself. So I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have stood it better&mdash;my coming here, I mean&mdash;if they
      hadn't come down to the station in a body to meet me in one of those long
      vehicles with seats down the sides: silly-looking men in coloured blazers
      and girls with no hats, all making a hullabaloo of welcome. "We are quite
      a small party," Mrs. Beverly-Jones had written. Small! Great heavens, what
      would they call a large one? And even those at the station turned out to
      be only half of them. There were just as many more all lined up on the
      piazza of the house as we drove up, all waving a fool welcome with tennis
      rackets and golf clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small party, indeed! Why, after six days there are still some of the
      idiots whose names I haven't got straight! That fool with the fluffy
      moustache, which is he? And that jackass that made the salad at the picnic
      yesterday, is he the brother of the woman with the guitar, or who?
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I mean is, there is something in that sort of noisy welcome that
      puts me to the bad at the start. It always does. A group of strangers all
      laughing together, and with a set of catchwords and jokes all their own,
      always throws me into a fit of sadness, deeper than words. I had thought,
      when Mrs. Beverly-Jones said a <i>small</i> party, she really meant small.
      I had had a mental picture of a few sad people, greeting me very quietly
      and gently, and of myself, quiet, too, but cheerful&mdash;somehow lifting
      them up, with no great effort, by my mere presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow from the very first I could feel that Beverly-Jones was
      disappointed in me. He said nothing. But I knew it. On that first
      afternoon, between my arrival and dinner, he took me about his place, to
      show it to me. I wish that at some proper time I had learned just what it
      is that you say when a man shows you about his place. I never knew before
      how deficient I am in it. I am all right to be shown an iron-and-steel
      plant, or a soda-water factory, or anything really wonderful, but being
      shown a house and grounds and trees, things that I have seen all my life,
      leaves me absolutely silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These big gates," said Beverly-Jones, "we only put up this year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," I said. That was all. Why shouldn't they put them up this year? I
      didn't care if they'd put them up this year or a thousand years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had quite a struggle," he continued, "before we finally decided on
      sandstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did, eh?" I said. There seemed nothing more to say; I didn't know
      what sort of struggle he meant, or who fought who; and personally
      sandstone or soapstone or any other stone is all the same to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This lawn," said Beverly-Jones, "we laid down the first year we were
      here." I answered nothing. He looked me right in the face as he said it
      and I looked straight back at him, but I saw no reason to challenge his
      statement. "The geraniums along the border," he went on, "are rather an
      experiment. They're Dutch."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked fixedly at the geraniums but never said a word. They were Dutch;
      all right, why not? They were an experiment. Very good; let them be so. I
      know nothing in particular to say about a Dutch experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could feel that Beverly-Jones grew depressed as he showed me round. I
      was sorry for him, but unable to help. I realized that there were certain
      sections of my education that had been neglected. How to be shown things
      and make appropriate comments seems to be an art in itself. I don't
      possess it. It is not likely now, as I look at this pond, that I ever
      shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet how simple a thing it seems when done by others. I saw the difference
      at once the very next day, the second day of my visit, when Beverly-Jones
      took round young Poppleton, the man that I mentioned above who will
      presently give a Swiss yodel from a clump of laurel bushes to indicate
      that the day's fun has begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poppleton I had known before slightly. I used to see him at the club. In
      club surroundings he always struck me as an ineffable young ass, loud and
      talkative and perpetually breaking the silence rules. Yet I have to admit
      that in his summer flannels and with a straw hat on he can do things that
      I can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These big gates," began Beverly-Jones as he showed Poppleton round the
      place with me trailing beside them, "we only put up this year."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poppleton, who has a summer place of his own, looked at the gates very
      critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, do you know what <i>I'd</i> have done with those gates, if they were
      mine?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Beverly-Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have set them two feet wider apart; they're too narrow, old chap, too
      narrow." Poppleton shook his head sadly at the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had quite a struggle," said Beverly-Jones, "before we finally decided
      on sandstone."
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized that he had one and the same line of talk that he always used.
      I resented it. No wonder it was easy for him. "Great mistake," said
      Poppleton. "Too soft. Look at this"&mdash;here he picked up a big stone
      and began pounding at the gate-post&mdash;"see how easily it chips!
      Smashes right off. Look at that, the whole corner knocks right off, see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly-Jones entered no protest. I began to see that there is a sort of
      understanding, a kind of freemasonry, among men who have summer places.
      One shows his things; the other runs them down, and smashes them. This
      makes the whole thing easy at once. Beverly-Jones showed his lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your turf is all wrong, old boy," said Poppleton. "Look! it has no body
      to it. See, I can kick holes in it with my heel. Look at that, and that!
      If I had on stronger boots I could kick this lawn all to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These geraniums along the border," said Beverly-Jones, "are rather an
      experiment. They're Dutch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my dear fellow," said Poppleton, "you've got them set in wrongly.
      They ought to slope <i>from</i> the sun you know, never <i>to</i> it. Wait
      a bit"&mdash;here he picked up a spade that was lying where a gardener had
      been working&mdash;"I'll throw a few out. Notice how easily they come up.
      Ah, that fellow broke! They're apt to. There, I won't bother to reset
      them, but tell your man to slope them over from the sun. That's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly-Jones showed his new boat-house next and Poppleton knocked a hole
      in the side with a hammer to show that the lumber was too thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that were <i>my</i> boat-house," he said, "I'd rip the outside clean
      off it and use shingle and stucco."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, I noticed, Poppleton's plan first to imagine Beverly-Jones's
      things his own, and then to smash them, and then give them back smashed to
      Beverly-Jones. This seemed to please them both. Apparently it is a
      well-understood method of entertaining a guest and being entertained.
      Beverly-Jones and Poppleton, after an hour or so of it, were delighted
      with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet somehow, when I tried it myself, it failed to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what I would do with that cedar summer-house if it was mine?"
      I asked my host the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd knock the thing down and burn it," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I think I must have said it too fiercely. Beverly-Jones looked hurt
      and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that these people are not doing all they can for me. I know that. I
      admit it. If I <i>should</i> meet my end here and if&mdash;to put the
      thing straight out&mdash;<i>my</i> lifeless body is found floating on the
      surface of this pond, I should like there to be documentary evidence of <i>that</i>
      much. They are trying their best. "This is Liberty Hall," Mrs.
      Beverly-Jones said to me on the first day of my visit. "We want you to
      feel that you are to do absolutely as you like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely as I like! How little they know me. I should like to have
      answered: "Madam, I have now reached a time of life when human society at
      breakfast is impossible to me; when any conversation prior to eleven a.m.
      must be considered out of the question; when I prefer to eat my meals in
      quiet, or with such mild hilarity as can be got from a comic paper; when I
      can no longer wear nankeen pants and a coloured blazer without a sense of
      personal indignity; when I can no longer leap and play in the water like a
      young fish; when I do not yodel, cannot sing and, to my regret; dance even
      worse than I did when young; and when the mood of mirth and hilarity comes
      to me only as a rare visitant&mdash;shall we say at a burlesque
      performance&mdash;and never as a daily part of my existence. Madam, I am
      unfit to be a summer guest. If this is Liberty Hall indeed, let me, oh,
      let me go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the speech that I would make if it were possible. As it is, I can
      only rehearse it to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the more I analyse it the more impossible it seems, for a man of
      my temperament at any rate, to be a summer guest. These people, and, I
      imagine, all other summer people, seem to be trying to live in a perpetual
      joke. Everything, all day, has to be taken in a mood of uproarious fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I can speak of it all now in quiet retrospect and without
      bitterness. It will soon be over now. Indeed, the reason why I have come
      down at this early hour to this quiet water is that things have reached a
      crisis. The situation has become extreme and I must end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened last night. Beverly-Jones took me aside while the others were
      dancing the fox-trot to the victrola on the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're planning to have some rather good fun to-morrow night," he said,
      "something that will be a good deal more in your line than a lot of it,
      I'm afraid, has been up here. In fact, my wife says that this will be the
      very thing for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're going to get all the people from the other houses over and the
      girls"&mdash;this term Beverly-Jones uses to mean his wife and her friends&mdash;"are
      going to get up a sort of entertainment with charades and things, all
      impromptu, more or less, of course&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," I said. I saw already what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they want you to act as a sort of master-of-ceremonies, to make up
      the gags and introduce the different stunts and all that. I was telling
      the girls about that afternoon at the club, when you were simply killing
      us all with those funny stories of yours, and they're all wild over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wild?" I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, quite wild over it. They say it will be the hit of the summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly-Jones shook hands with great warmth as we parted for the night. I
      knew that he was thinking that my character was about to be triumphantly
      vindicated, and that he was glad for my sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night I did not sleep. I remained awake all night thinking of the
      "entertainment." In my whole life I have done nothing in public except
      once when I presented a walking-stick to the vice-president of our club on
      the occasion of his taking a trip to Europe. Even for that I used to
      rehearse to myself far into the night sentences that began: "This
      walking-stick, gentleman, means far more than a mere walking-stick."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they expect me to come out as a merry master-of-ceremonies before
      an assembled crowd of summer guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      But never mind. It is nearly over now. I have come down to this quiet
      water in the early morning to throw myself in. They will find me floating
      here among the lilies. Some few will understand. I can see it written, as
      it will be, in the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes the sad fatality doubly poignant is that the unhappy victim
      had just entered upon a holiday visit that was to have been prolonged
      throughout the whole month. Needless to say, he was regarded as the life
      and soul of the pleasant party of holiday makers that had gathered at the
      delightful country home of Mr. and Mrs. Beverly-Jones. Indeed, on the very
      day of the tragedy, he was to have taken a leading part in staging a merry
      performance of charades and parlour entertainments&mdash;a thing for which
      his genial talents and overflowing high spirits rendered him specially
      fit."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they read that, those who know me best will understand how and why I
      died. "He had still over three weeks to stay there," they will say. "He
      was to act as the stage manager of charades." They will shake their heads.
      They will understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is this? I raise my eyes from the paper and I see Beverly-Jones
      hurriedly approaching from the house. He is hastily dressed, with flannel
      trousers and a dressing-gown. His face looks grave. Something has
      happened. Thank God, something has happened. Some accident! Some tragedy!
      Something to prevent the charades!
    </p>
    <p>
      I write these few lines on a fast train that is carrying me back to New
      York, a cool, comfortable train, with a deserted club-car where I can sit
      in a leather arm-chair, with my feet up on another, smoking, silent, and
      at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villages, farms and summer places are flying by. Let them fly. I, too, am
      flying&mdash;back to the rest and quiet of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old man," Beverly-Jones said, as he laid his hand on mine very kindly&mdash;he
      is a decent fellow, after all, is Jones&mdash;"they're calling you by
      long-distance from New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" I asked, or tried to gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's bad news, old chap; fire in your office last evening. I'm afraid a
      lot of your private papers were burned. Robinson&mdash;that's your senior
      clerk, isn't it?&mdash;seems to have been on the spot trying to save
      things. He's badly singed about the face and hands. I'm afraid you must go
      at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," I said, "at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I've told the man to get the trap ready right away. You've just
      time to catch the seven-ten. Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," I said. I kept my face as well as I could, trying to hide my
      exultation. The office burnt! Fine! Robinson's singed! Glorious! I
      hurriedly packed my things and whispered to Beverly-Jones farewell
      messages for the sleeping household. I never felt so jolly and facetious
      in my life. I could feel that Beverly-Jones was admiring the spirit and
      pluck with which I took my misfortune. Later on he would tell them all
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trap ready! Hurrah! Good-bye, old man! Hurrah! All right. I'll
      telegraph. Right you are, good-bye. Hip, hip, hurrah! Here we are! Train
      right on time. Just these two bags, porter, and there's a dollar for you.
      What merry, merry fellows these darky porters are, anyway!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so here I am in the train, safe bound for home and the summer quiet of
      my club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well done for Robinson! I was afraid that it had missed fire, or that my
      message to him had gone wrong. It was on the second day of my visit that I
      sent word to him to invent an accident&mdash;something, anything&mdash;to
      call me back. I thought the message had failed. I had lost hope. But it is
      all right now, though he certainly pitched the note pretty high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I can't let the Beverly-Joneses know that it was a put-up job. I
      must set fire to the office as soon as I get back. But it's worth it. And
      I'll have to singe Robinson about the face and hands. But it's worth that
      too!

    <h2>
      VI. To Nature and Back Again
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was probably owing to the fact that my place of lodgment in New York
      overlooked the waving trees of Central Park that I was consumed, all the
      summer through, with a great longing for the woods. To me, as a lover of
      Nature, the waving of a tree conveys thoughts which are never conveyed to
      me except by seeing a tree wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This longing grew upon me. I became restless with it. In the daytime I
      dreamed over my work. At night my sleep was broken and restless. At times
      I would even wander forth, at night into the park, and there, deep in the
      night shadow of the trees, imagine myself alone in the recesses of the
      dark woods remote from the toil and fret of our distracted civilization.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
This increasing feeling culminated in the resolve which becomes the
subject of this narrative. The thought came to me suddenly one night. I
woke from my sleep with a plan fully matured in my mind. It was this:
I would, for one month, cast off all the travail and cares of civilized
life and become again the wild man of the woods that Nature made me. M
 woods, somewhere in New England, divest myself of my clothes&mdash;except
only my union suit&mdash;crawl into the woods, stay there a month and then
crawl out again. To a trained woodsman and crawler like myself the thing
was simplicity itself. For food I knew that I could rely on berries,
roots, shoots, mosses, mushrooms, fungi, bungi&mdash;in fact the whole of
Nature's ample storehouse; for my drink, the running brook and the quiet
pool; and for my companions the twittering chipmunk, the chickadee,
the chocktaw, the choo-choo, the chow-chow, and the hundred and one
inhabitants of the forgotten glade and the tangled thicket.
</pre>
    <p>
      Fortunately for me, my resolve came to me upon the last day in August. The
      month of September was my vacation. My time was my own. I was free to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my rising in the morning my preparations were soon made; or, rather,
      there were practically no preparations to make. I had but to supply myself
      with a camera, my one necessity in the woods, and to say good-bye to my
      friends. Even this last ordeal I wished to make as brief as possible. I
      had no wish to arouse their anxiety over the dangerous, perhaps foolhardy,
      project that I had in mind. I wished, as far as possible, to say good-bye
      in such a way as to allay the very natural fears which my undertaking
      would excite in the minds of my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      From myself, although trained in the craft of the woods, I could not
      conceal the danger that I incurred. Yet the danger was almost forgotten in
      the extraordinary and novel interest that attached to the experiment.
      Would it prove possible for a man, unaided by our civilized arts and
      industries, to maintain himself naked&mdash;except for his union suit&mdash;in
      the heart of the woods? Could he do it, or could he not? And if he
      couldn't what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      But this last thought I put from me. Time alone could answer the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in duty bound, I went first to the place of business where I am
      employed, to shake hands and say good-bye to my employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going," I said, "to spend a month naked alone in the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up from his desk with genial kindliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," he said, "get a good rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My plan is," I added, "to live on berries and funguses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine," he answered. "Well, have a good time, old man&mdash;good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I dropped in casually upon one of my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," I said, "I'm off to New England to spend a month naked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nantucket," he said, "or Newport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I answered, speaking as lightly as I could. "I'm going into the
      woods and stay there naked for a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," he said. "I see. Well, good-bye, old chap&mdash;see you when
      you get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I called upon two or three other men to say a brief word of
      farewell. I could not help feeling slightly nettled, I must confess, at
      the very casual way in which they seemed to take my announcement. "Oh,
      yes," they said, "naked in the woods, eh? Well, ta-ta till you get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a man about to risk his life&mdash;for there was no denying the
      fact&mdash;in a great sociological experiment, yet they received the
      announcement with absolute unconcern. It offered one more assurance, had I
      needed it, of the degenerate state of the civilization upon which I was
      turning my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way to the train I happened to run into a newspaper reporter with
      whom I have some acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm just off," I said, "to New England to spend a month naked&mdash;at
      least naked all but my union suit&mdash;in the woods; no doubt you'll like
      a few details about it for your paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, old man," he said, "we've pretty well given up running that
      nature stuff. We couldn't do anything with it&mdash;unless, of course,
      anything happens to you. Then we'd be glad to give you some space."
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of my friends had at least the decency to see me off on the train.
      One, and one alone accompanied me on the long night-ride to New England in
      order that he might bring back my clothes, my watch, and other possessions
      from the point where I should enter the woods, together with such few
      messages of farewell as I might scribble at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early morning when we arrived at the wayside station where we were
      to alight. From here we walked to the edge of the woods. Arrived at this
      point we halted. I took off my clothes, with the exception of my union
      suit. Then, taking a pot of brown stain from my valise, I proceeded to dye
      my face and hands and my union suit itself a deep butternut brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that for?" asked my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For protection," I answered. "Don't you know that all animals are
      protected by their peculiar markings that render them invisible? The
      caterpillar looks like the leaf it eats from; the scales of the fish
      counterfeit the glistening water of the brook; the bear and the 'possum
      are coloured like the tree-trunks on which they climb. There!" I added, as
      I concluded my task. "I am now invisible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee!" said my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed him back the valise and the empty paint-pot, dropped to my hands
      and knees&mdash;my camera slung about my neck&mdash;and proceeded to crawl
      into the bush. My friend stood watching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you stand up and walk?" I heard him call.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned half round and growled at him. Then I plunged deeper into the
      bush, growling as I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      After ten minutes' active crawling I found myself in the heart of the
      forest. It reached all about me on every side for hundreds of miles. All
      around me was the unbroken stillness of the woods. Not a sound reached my
      ear save the twittering of a squirrel, or squirl, in the branches high
      above my head or the far-distant call of a loon hovering over some
      woodland lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I judged that I had reached a spot suitable for my habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first care was to make a fire. Difficult though it might appear to the
      degenerate dweller of the city to do this, to the trained woodsman, such
      as I had now become, it is nothing. I selected a dry stick, rubbed it
      vigorously against my hind leg, and in a few moments it broke into a
      generous blaze. Half an hour later I was sitting beside a glowing fire of
      twigs discussing with great gusto an appetizing mess of boiled grass and
      fungi cooked in a hollow stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ate my fill, not pausing till I was full, careless, as the natural man
      ever is, of the morrow. Then, stretched out upon the pine-needles at the
      foot of a great tree, I lay in drowsy contentment listening to the song of
      the birds, the hum of the myriad insects and the strident note of the
      squirrel high above me. At times I would give utterance to the soft
      answering call, known to every woodsman, that is part of the freemasonry
      of animal speech. As I lay thus, I would not have exchanged places with
      the pale dweller in the city for all the wealth in the world. Here I lay
      remote from the world, happy, full of grass, listening to the crooning of
      the birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mood of inaction and reflection cannot last, even with the lover
      of Nature. It was time to be up and doing. Much lay before me to be done
      before the setting of the sun should bring with it, as I fully expected it
      would, darkness. Before night fell I must build a house, make myself a
      suit of clothes, lay in a store of nuts, and in short prepare myself for
      the oncoming of winter, which, in the bush, may come on at any time in the
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose briskly from the ground to my hands and knees and set myself to the
      building of my house. The method that I intended to follow here was merely
      that which Nature has long since taught to the beaver and which, moreover,
      is known and practised by the gauchos of the pampas, by the googoos of
      Rhodesia and by many other tribes. I had but to select a suitable growth
      of trees and gnaw them down with my teeth, taking care so to gnaw them
      that each should fall into the place appointed for it in the building. The
      sides, once erected in this fashion, another row of trees, properly
      situated, is gnawed down to fall crosswise as the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set myself briskly to work and in half an hour had already the
      satisfaction of seeing my habitation rising into shape. I was still
      gnawing with unabated energy when I was interrupted by a low growling in
      the underbrush. With animal caution I shrank behind a tree, growling in
      return. I could see something moving in the bushes, evidently an animal of
      large size. From its snarl I judged it to be a bear. I could hear it
      moving nearer to me. It was about to attack me. A savage joy thrilled
      through me at the thought, while my union suit bristled with rage from
      head to foot as I emitted growl after growl of defiance. I bared my teeth
      to the gums, snarling, and lashed my flank with my hind foot. Eagerly I
      watched for the onrush of the bear. In savage combat who strikes first
      wins. It was my idea, as soon as the bear should appear, to bite off its
      front legs one after the other. This initial advantage once gained, I had
      no doubt of ultimate victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brushes parted. I caught a glimpse of a long brown body and a hairy
      head. Then the creature reared up, breasting itself against a log, full in
      front of me. Great heavens! It was not a bear at all. It was a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed, as I was, in a union suit, and his face and hands, like
      mine, were stained a butternut brown. His hair was long and matted and two
      weeks' stubble of beard was on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute we both glared at one another, still growling. Then the man
      rose up to a standing position with a muttered exclamation of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, cut it out," he said. "Let's talk English."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked over towards me and sat down upon a log in an attitude that
      seemed to convey the same disgust as the expression of his features. Then
      he looked round about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Building a house," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," he said with a nod. "What are you here for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," I explained, "my plan is this: I want to see whether a man can come
      out here in the woods, naked, with no aid but that of his own hands and
      his own ingenuity and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I know," interrupted the disconsolate man. "Earn himself a
      livelihood in the wilderness, live as the cave-man lived, carefree and far
      from the curse of civilization!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. That was my idea," I said, my enthusiasm rekindling as I
      spoke. "That's what I'm doing; my food is to be the rude grass and the
      roots that Nature furnishes for her children, and for my drink&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," he interrupted again with impatience, "for your drink the
      running rill, for your bed the sweet couch of hemlock, and for your canopy
      the open sky lit with the soft stars in the deep-purple vault of the dewy
      night. I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great heavens, man!" I exclaimed. "That's my idea exactly. In fact, those
      are my very phrases. How could you have guessed it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture with his hand to indicate weariness and disillusionment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" he said. "I know it because I've been doing it. I've been here a
      fortnight now on this open-air, life-in-the-woods game. Well, I'm sick of
      it! This last lets me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What last?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, meeting you. Do you realize that you are the nineteenth man that
      I've met in the last three days running about naked in the woods? They're
      all doing it. The woods are full of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so!" I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact. Wherever you go in the bush you find naked men all working out this
      same blasted old experiment. Why, when you get a little farther in you'll
      see signs up: NAKED MEN NOT ALLOWED IN THIS BUSH, and NAKED MEN KEEP OFF,
      and GENTLEMEN WHO ARE NAKED WILL KINDLY KEEP TO THE HIGH ROAD, and a lot
      of things like that. You must have come in at a wrong place or you'd have
      noticed the little shanties that they have now at the edge of the New
      England bush with signs up: UNION SUITS BOUGHT AND SOLD, CAMERAS FOR SALE
      OR TO RENT, HIGHEST PRICE FOR CAST-OFF CLOTHING, and all that sort of
      thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I said. "I saw nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you look when you go back. As for me, I'm done with it. The thing's
      worked out. I'm going back to the city to see whether I can't, right there
      in the heart of the city, earn myself a livelihood with my unaided hands
      and brains. That's the real problem; no more bumming on the animals for
      me. This bush business is too easy. Well, good-bye; I'm off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But stop a minute," I said. "How is it that, if what you say is true, I
      haven't seen or heard anybody in the bush, and I've been here since the
      middle of the morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," the man answered. "They were probably all round you but you
      didn't recognize them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, it's not possible. I lay here dreaming beneath a tree and there
      wasn't a sound, except the twittering of a squirrel and, far away, the cry
      of a lake-loon, nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, the twittering of a squirrel! That was some feller up the tree
      twittering to beat the band to let on that he was a squirrel, and no doubt
      some other feller calling out like a loon over near the lake. I suppose
      you gave them the answering cry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," I said. "I gave that low guttural note which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely&mdash;which is the universal greeting in the freemasonry of
      animal speech. I see you've got it all down pat. Well, good-bye again. I'm
      off. Oh, don't bother to growl, please. I'm sick of that line of stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slid through the bushes and disappeared. I sat where I was, musing, my
      work interrupted, a mood of bitter disillusionment heavy upon me. So I
      sat, it may have been for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the far distance I could hear the faint cry of a bittern in some lonely
      marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, who the deuce is making that noise?" I muttered. "Some silly fool, I
      suppose, trying to think he's a waterfowl. Cut it out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Long I lay, my dream of the woods shattered, wondering what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly there came to my ear the loud sound of voices, human voices,
      strident and eager, with nothing of the animal growl in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's in there. I seen him!" I heard some one call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapidly I dived sideways into the underbrush, my animal instinct strong
      upon me again, growling as I went. Instinctively I knew that it was I that
      they were after. All the animal joy of being hunted came over me. My union
      suit stood up on end with mingled fear and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As fast as I could I retreated into the wood. Yet somehow, as I moved, the
      wood, instead of growing denser, seemed to thin out. I crouched low, still
      growling and endeavouring to bury myself in the thicket. I was filled with
      a wild sense of exhilaration such as any lover of the wild life would feel
      at the knowledge that he is being chased, that some one is after him, that
      some one is perhaps just a few feet behind him, waiting to stick a
      pitchfork into him as he runs. There is no ecstasy like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I realized that my pursuers had closed in on me. I was surrounded on
      all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods had somehow grown thin. They were like the mere shrubbery of a
      park&mdash;it might be of Central Park itself. I could hear among the
      deeper tones of men the shrill voices of boys. "There he is," one cried,
      "going through them bushes! Look at him humping himself!" "What is it,
      what's the sport?" another called. "Some crazy guy loose in the park in
      his underclothes and the cops after him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they closed in on me. I recognized the blue suits of the police force
      and their short clubs. In a few minutes I was dragged out of the shrubbery
      and stood in the open park in my pyjamas, wide awake, shivering in the
      chilly air of early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for me, it was decided at the police-court that sleep-walking
      is not an offence against the law. I was dismissed with a caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      My vacation is still before me, and I still propose to spend it naked. But
      I shall do so at Atlantic City.

    <h2>
      VII. The Cave-Man as He is
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think it likely that few people besides myself have ever actually seen
      and spoken with a "cave-man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet everybody nowadays knows all about the cave-man. The fifteen-cent
      magazines and the new fiction have made him a familiar figure. A few years
      ago, it is true, nobody had ever heard of him. But lately, for some reason
      or other, there has been a run on the cave-man. No up-to-date story is
      complete without one or two references to him. The hero, when the heroine
      slights him, is said to "feel for a moment the wild, primordial desire of
      the cave-man, the longing to seize her, to drag her with him, to carry her
      away, to make her his." When he takes her in his arms it is recorded that
      "all the elemental passion of the cave-man surges through him." When he
      fights, on her behalf against a dray-man or a gun-man or an ice-man or any
      other compound that makes up a modern villain, he is said to "feel all the
      fierce fighting joy of the cave-man." If they kick him in the ribs, he
      likes it. If they beat him over the head, he never feels it; because he
      is, for the moment, a cave-man. And the cave-man is, and is known to be,
      quite above sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heroine, too, shares the same point of view. "Take me," she murmurs as
      she falls into the hero's embrace, "be my cave-man." As she says it there
      is, so the writer assures us, something of the fierce light of the
      cave-woman in her eyes, the primordial woman to be wooed and won only by
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, like everybody else, I had, till I saw him, a great idea of the
      cave-man. I had a clear mental picture of him&mdash;huge, brawny,
      muscular, a wolfskin thrown about him and a great war-club in his hand. I
      knew him as without fear with nerves untouched by our effete civilization,
      fighting, as the beasts fight, to the death, killing without pity and
      suffering without a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a picture that I could not but admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked, too&mdash;I am free to confess it&mdash;his peculiar way with
      women. His system was, as I understood it, to take them by the neck and
      bring them along with him. That was his fierce, primordial way of "wooing"
      them. And they liked it. So at least we are informed by a thousand
      credible authorities. They liked it. And the modern woman, so we are told,
      would still like it if only one dared to try it on. There's the trouble;
      if one only <i>dared</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I see lots of them&mdash;I'll be frank about it&mdash;that I should like
      to grab, to sling over my shoulder and carry away with me; or, what is the
      same thing, allowing for modern conditions, have an express man carry
      them. I notice them at Atlantic City, I see them in Fifth Avenue&mdash;yes,
      everywhere. But would they come? That's the <i>deuce</i> of it. Would they
      come right along, like the cave-woman, merely biting off my ear as they
      came, or are they degenerate enough to bring an action against me,
      indicting the express company as a party of the second part?
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubts such as these prevent me from taking active measures. But they
      leave me, as they leave many another man, preoccupied and fascinated with
      the cave-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      One may imagine, then, my extraordinary interest in him when I actually
      met him in the flesh. Yet the thing came about quite simply, indeed more
      by accident than by design, an adventure open to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that I spent my vacation in Kentucky&mdash;the region, as
      everybody knows, of the great caves. They extend&mdash;it is a matter of
      common knowledge&mdash;for hundreds of miles; in some places dark and
      sunless tunnels, the black silence broken only by the dripping of the
      water from the roof; in other places great vaults like subterranean
      temples, with vast stone arches sweeping to the dome, and with deep, still
      water of unfathomed depth as the floor; and here and there again they are
      lighted from above through rifts in the surface of the earth, and are dry
      and sand strewn&mdash;fit for human habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such caves as these&mdash;so has the obstinate legend run for centuries&mdash;there
      still dwell cave-men, the dwindling remnant of their race. And here it was
      that I came across him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had penetrated into the caves far beyond my guides. I carried a revolver
      and had with me an electric lantern, but the increasing sunlight in the
      cave as I went on had rendered the latter needless.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sat, a huge figure, clad in a great wolfskin. Besides him lay a
      great club. Across his knee was a spear round which he was binding sinews
      that tightened under his muscular hand. His head was bent over his task.
      His matted hair had fallen over his eyes. He did not see me till I was
      close beside him on the sanded floor of the cave. I gave a slight cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me!" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cave-man gave a startled jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My goodness," he said, "you startled me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see that he was quite trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You came along so suddenly," he said, "it gave me the jumps." Then he
      muttered, more to himself than to me, "Too much of this darned cave-water!
      I must quit drinking it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down near to the Caveman on a stone, taking care to place my
      revolver carefully behind it. I don't mind admitting that a loaded
      revolver, especially as I get older, makes me nervous. I was afraid that
      he might start fooling with it. One can't be too careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a way of opening conversation I picked up the Cave-man's club.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," I said, "that's a great club you have, eh? By gee! it's heavy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out!" said the Cave-man with a certain agitation in his voice as he
      reached out and took the club from me. "Don't fool with that club! It's
      loaded! You know you could easily drop the club on your toes, or on mine.
      A man can't be too careful with a loaded club."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as he said this and carried the club to the other side of the
      cave, where he leant it against the wall. Now that he stood up and I could
      examine him he no longer looked so big. In fact he was not big at all. The
      effect of size must have come, I think, from the great wolfskin that he
      wore. I have noticed the same thing in Grand Opera. I noticed, too, for
      the first time that the cave we were in seemed fitted up, in a rude sort
      of way, like a dwelling-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a nice place you've got," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dandy, isn't it?" he said, as he cast his eyes around. "<i>She</i> fixed
      it up. She's got great taste. See that mud sideboard? That's the real
      thing, A-one mud! None of your cheap rock about that. We fetched that mud
      for two miles to make that. And look at that wicker bucket. Isn't it
      great? Hardly leaks at all except through the sides, and perhaps a little
      through the bottom. <i>She</i> wove that. She's a humdinger at weaving."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was moving about as he spoke, showing me all his little belongings. He
      reminded me for all the world of a man in a Harlem flat, showing a visitor
      how convenient it all is. Somehow, too, the Cave-man had lost all
      appearance of size. He looked, in fact, quite little, and when he had
      pushed his long hair back from his forehead he seemed to wear that same,
      worried, apologetic look that we all have. To a higher being, if there is
      such, our little faces one and all appear, no doubt, pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that he must be speaking about his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife?" he said. "Oh, she's gone out somewhere through the caves with
      the kid. You didn't meet our kid as you came along, did you? No? Well,
      he's the greatest boy you even saw. He was only two this nineteenth of
      August. And you should hear him say 'Pop' and 'Mom' just as if he was
      grown up. He is really, I think, about the brightest boy I've ever known&mdash;I
      mean quite apart from being his father, and speaking of him as if he were
      anyone else's boy. You didn't meet them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I said, "I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well," the Cave-man went on, "there are lots of ways and passages
      through. I guess they went in another direction. The wife generally likes
      to take a stroll round in the morning and see some of the neighbours. But,
      say," he interrupted, "I guess I'm forgetting my manners. Let me get you a
      drink of cave-water. Here, take it in this stone mug! There you are, say
      when! Where do we get it? Oh, we find it in parts of the cave where it
      filters through the soil above. Alcoholic? Oh, yes, about fifteen per
      cent, I think. Some say it soaks all through the soil of this State. Sit
      down and be comfortable, and, say if you hear the woman coming just slip
      your mug behind that stone out of sight. Do you mind? Now, try one of
      these elm-root cigars. Oh, pick a good one&mdash;there are lots of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We seated ourselves in some comfort on the soft sand, our backs against
      the boulders, sipping cave-water and smoking elm-root cigars. It seemed
      altogether as if one were back in civilization, talking to a genial host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the Cave-man, and he spoke, as it were, in a large and
      patronizing way. "I generally let my wife trot about as she likes in the
      daytime. She and the other women nowadays are getting up all these
      different movements, and the way I look at it is that if it amuses her to
      run around and talk and attend meetings, why let her do it. Of course," he
      continued, assuming a look of great firmness, "if I liked to put my foot
      down&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, exactly," I said. "It's the same way with us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it now!" he questioned with interest. "I had imagined that it was all
      different Outside. You're from the Outside, aren't you? I guessed you must
      be from the skins you wear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you never been Outside?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear!" said the Cave-man. "Not for mine! Down here in the caves, clean
      underground and mostly in the dark, it's all right. It's nice and safe."
      He gave a sort of shudder. "Gee! You fellows out there must have your
      nerve to go walking around like that on the outside rim of everything,
      where the stars might fall on you or a thousand things happen to you. But
      then you Outside Men have got a natural elemental fearlessness about you
      that we Cave-men have lost. I tell you, I was pretty scared when I looked
      up and saw you standing there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you never seen any Outside Men?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes," he answered, "but never close. The most I've done is to go out
      to the edges of the cave sometimes and look out and see them, Outside Men
      and Women, in the distance. But of course, in one way or another, we
      Cave-men know all about them. And the thing we envy most in you Outside
      Men is the way you treat your women! By gee! You take no nonsense from
      them&mdash;you fellows are the real primordial, primitive men. We've lost
      it somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear fellow&mdash;" I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Cave-man, who had sat suddenly upright, interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick! quick!" he said. "Hide that infernal mug! She's coming. Don't you
      hear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke I caught the sound of a woman's voice somewhere in the outer
      passages of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Willie," she was saying, speaking evidently to the Cave-child, "you
      come right along back with me, and if I ever catch you getting in such a
      mess as that again I'll never take you anywhere, so there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had grown louder. She entered the cave as she spoke&mdash;a
      big-boned woman in a suit of skins leading by the hand a pathetic little
      mite in a rabbit-skin, with blue eyes and a slobbered face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as I was sitting the Cave-woman evidently couldn't see me; for she
      turned at once to speak to her husband, unconscious of my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of all the idle creatures!" she exclaimed. "Loafing here in the
      sand"&mdash;she gave a sniff&mdash;"and smoking&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," began the Cave-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you my-dear me!" she answered. "Look at this place! Nothing tidied
      up yet and the day half through! Did you put the alligator on to boil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just going to say&mdash;" began the Cave-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Going</i> to say! Yes, I don't doubt you were going to say. You'd go
      on saying all day if I'd let you. What I'm asking you is, is the alligator
      on to boil for dinner or is it not&mdash;My gracious!" She broke off all
      of a sudden, as she caught sight of me. "Why didn't you say there was
      company? Land sakes! And you sit there and never say there was a gentleman
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hustled across the cave and was busily arranging her hair with a
      pool of water as a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious!" she said, "I'm a perfect fright! You must excuse me," she
      added, looking round toward me, "for being in this state. I'd just slipped
      on this old fur blouse and run around to a neighbour's and I'd no idea
      that he was going to bring in company. Just like him! I'm afraid we've
      nothing but a plain alligator stew to offer you, but I'm sure if you'll
      stay to dinner&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was hustling about already, good primitive housewife that she was,
      making the stone-plates rattle on the mud table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, really&mdash;" I began. But I was interrupted by a sudden
      exclamation from both the Cave-man and the Cave-woman together:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willie! where's Willie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious!" cried the woman. "He's wandered out alone&mdash;oh, hurry,
      look for him! Something might get him! He may have fallen in the water!
      Oh, hurry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were off in a moment, shouting into the dark passages of the outer
      cave: "Willie! Willie!" There was agonized anxiety in their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then in a moment, as it seemed, they were back again, with Willie in
      their arms, blubbering, his rabbit-skin all wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness gracious!" said the Cave-woman. "He'd fallen right in, the poor
      little man. Hurry, dear, and get something dry to wrap him in! Goodness,
      what a fright! Quick, darling, give me something to rub him with."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiously the Cave-parents moved about beside the child, all quarrel
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely," I said, as they calmed down a little, "just there where
      Willie fell in, beside the passage that I came through, there is only
      three inches of water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there is," they said, both together, "but just suppose it had been
      three feet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, when Willie was restored, they both renewed their invitation to
      me to stay to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you say," said the Cave-man, "that you wanted to make some notes
      on the difference between Cave-people and the people of your world of
      to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you," I answered, "I have already all the notes I want!"

      I. WITH A EUROPEAN PRINCE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      With any European Prince, travelling in America
    </h3>
    <p>
      On receiving our card the Prince, to our great surprise and pleasure, sent
      down a most cordial message that he would be delighted to see us at once.
      This thrilled us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take us," we said to the elevator boy, "to the apartments of the Prince."
      We were pleased to see him stagger and lean against his wheel to get his
      breath back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments we found ourselves crossing the threshold of the Prince's
      apartments. The Prince, who is a charming young man of from twenty-six to
      twenty-seven, came across the floor to meet us with an extended hand and a
      simple gesture of welcome. We have seldom seen anyone come across the
      floor more simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, who is travelling incognito as the Count of Flim Flam, was
      wearing, when we saw him, the plain morning dress of a gentleman of
      leisure. We learned that a little earlier he had appeared at breakfast in
      the costume of a Unitarian clergyman, under the incognito of the Bishop of
      Bongee; while later on he appeared at lunch, as a delicate compliment to
      our city, in the costume of a Columbia professor of Yiddish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince greeted us with the greatest cordiality, seated himself,
      without the slightest affectation, and motioned to us, with indescribable
      bonhomie, his permission to remain standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the Prince, "what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We need hardly say that the Prince, who is a consummate master of ten
      languages, speaks English quite as fluently as he does Chinese. Indeed,
      for a moment, we could scarcely tell which he was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your impressions of the United States?" we asked as we took out
      our notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid," answered the Prince, with the delightful smile which is
      characteristic of him, and which we noticed again and again during the
      interview, "that I must scarcely tell you that."
    </p>
    <p>
      We realized immediately that we were in the presence not only of a soldier
      but of one of the most consummate diplomats of the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May we ask then," we resumed, correcting our obvious blunder, "what are
      your impressions, Prince, of the Atlantic Ocean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the Prince, with that peculiar thoughtfulness which is so
      noticeable in him and which we observed not once but several times, "the
      Atlantic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Volumes could not have expressed his thought better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you," we asked, "see any ice during your passage across?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the Prince, "ice! Let me think."
    </p>
    <p>
      We did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ice," repeated the Prince thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      We realized that we were in the presence not only of a soldier, a linguist
      and a diplomat, but of a trained scientist accustomed to exact research.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ice!" repeated the Prince. "Did I see any ice? No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have been more decisive, more final than the clear, simple
      brevity of the Prince's "No." He had seen no ice. He knew he had seen no
      ice. He said he had seen no ice. Nothing could have been more
      straightforward, more direct. We felt assured from that moment that the
      Prince had not seen any ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exquisite good taste with which the Prince had answered our question
      served to put us entirely at our ease, and we presently found ourselves
      chatting with His Highness with the greatest freedom and without the
      slightest <i>gene</i> or <i>mauvaise honte</i>, or, in fact, <i>malvoisie</i>
      of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We realized, indeed, that we were in the presence not only of a trained
      soldier, a linguist and a diplomat, but also of a conversationalist of the
      highest order.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Highness, who has an exquisite sense of humour&mdash;indeed, it broke
      out again and again during our talk with him&mdash;expressed himself as
      both amused and perplexed over our American money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very difficult," he said, "with us it is so simple; six and a half
      groner are equal to one and a third gross-groner or the quarter part of
      our Rigsdaler. Here it is so complicated."
    </p>
    <p>
      We ventured to show the Prince a fifty-cent piece and to explain its value
      by putting two quarters beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said the Prince, whose mathematical ability is quite exceptional,
      "two twenty-five-cent pieces are equal to one fifty-cent piece. I must try
      to remember that. Meantime," he added, with a gesture of royal
      condescension, putting the money in his pocket, "I will keep your coins as
      instructors"&mdash;we murmured our thanks&mdash;"and now explain to me,
      please, your five-dollar gold piece and your ten-dollar eagle."
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt it proper, however, to shift the subject, and asked the Prince a
      few questions in regard to his views on American politics. We soon found
      that His Highness, although this is his first visit to this continent, is
      a keen student of our institutions and our political life. Indeed, His
      Altitude showed by his answers to our questions that he is as well
      informed about our politics as we are ourselves. On being asked what he
      viewed as the uppermost tendency in our political life of to-day, the
      Prince replied thoughtfully that he didn't know. To our inquiry as to
      whether in his opinion democracy was moving forward or backward, the
      Prince, after a moment of reflection, answered that he had no idea. On our
      asking which of the generals of our Civil War was regarded in Europe as
      the greatest strategist, His Highness answered without hesitation, "George
      Washington."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before closing our interview the Prince, who, like his illustrious father,
      is an enthusiastic sportsman, completely turned the tables on us by
      inquiring eagerly about the prospects for large game in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      We told him something&mdash;as much as we could recollect&mdash;of
      woodchuck hunting in our own section of the country. The Prince was
      interested at once. His eye lighted up, and the peculiar air of fatigue,
      or languor, which we had thought to remark on his face during our
      interview, passed entirely off his features. He asked us a number of
      questions, quickly and without pausing, with the air, in fact, of a man
      accustomed to command and not to listen. How was the woodchuck hunted?
      From horseback or from an elephant? Or from an armoured car, or turret?
      How many beaters did one use to beat up the woodchuck? What bearers was it
      necessary to carry with one? How great a danger must one face of having
      one's beaters killed? What percentage of risk must one be prepared to
      incur of accidentally shooting one's own beaters? What did a bearer cost?
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these questions we answered as best we could, the Prince apparently
      seizing the gist, or essential part of our answer, before we had said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In concluding the discussion we ventured to ask His Highness for his
      autograph. The Prince, who has perhaps a more exquisite sense of humour
      than any other sovereign of Europe, declared with a laugh that he had no
      pen. Still roaring over this inimitable drollery, we begged the Prince to
      honour us by using our own fountain-pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any ink in it?" asked the Prince&mdash;which threw us into a
      renewed paroxysm of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince took the pen and very kindly autographed for us seven
      photographs of himself. He offered us more, but we felt that seven was
      about all we could use. We were still suffocated with laughter over the
      Prince's wit; His Highness was still signing photographs when an equerry
      appeared and whispered in the Prince's ear. His Highness, with the
      consummate tact to be learned only at a court, turned quietly without a
      word and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      We never, in all our experience, remember seeing a prince&mdash;or a mere
      man for the matter of that&mdash;leave a room with greater suavity,
      discretion, or aplomb. It was a revelation of breeding, of race, of long
      slavery to caste. And yet, with it all, it seemed to have a touch of
      finality about it&mdash;a hint that the entire proceeding was deliberate,
      planned, not to be altered by circumstance. He did not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand that he appeared later in the morning at a civic reception
      in the costume of an Alpine Jaeger, and attended the matinee in the dress
      of a lieutenant of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime he has our pen. If he turns up in any costume that we can spot at
      sight, we shall ask him for it.

    <h2>
      II. WITH OUR GREATEST ACTOR
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   That is to say, with Any One of
   our Sixteen Greatest Actors
</pre>
    <p>
      It was within the privacy of his own library that we obtained&mdash;need
      we say with infinite difficulty&mdash;our interview with the Great Actor.
      He was sitting in a deep arm-chair, so buried in his own thoughts that he
      was oblivious of our approach. On his knee before him lay a cabinet
      photograph of himself. His eyes seemed to be peering into it, as if
      seeking to fathom its unfathomable mystery. We had time to note that a
      beautiful carbon photogravure of himself stood on a table at his elbow,
      while a magnificent half-tone pastel of himself was suspended on a string
      from the ceiling. It was only when we had seated ourself in a chair and
      taken out our notebook that the Great Actor looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An interview?" he said, and we noted with pain the weariness in his tone.
      "Another interview!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Publicity!" he murmured rather to himself than to us. "Publicity! Why
      must one always be forced into publicity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not our intention, we explained apologetically, to publish or to
      print a single word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, what?" exclaimed the Great Actor. "Not print it? Not publish it? Then
      what in&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Not, we explained, without his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," he murmured wearily, "my consent. Yes, yes, I must give it. The
      world demands it. Print, publish anything you like. I am indifferent to
      praise, careless of fame. Posterity will judge me. But," he added more
      briskly, "let me see a proof of it in time to make any changes I might
      care to."
    </p>
    <p>
      We bowed our assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," we began, "may we be permitted to ask a few questions about
      your art? And first, in which branch of the drama do you consider that
      your genius chiefly lies, in tragedy or in comedy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In both," said the Great Actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You excel then," we continued, "in neither the one nor the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," he answered, "I excel in each of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse us," we said, "we haven't made our meaning quite clear. What we
      meant to say is, stated very simply, that you do not consider yourself
      better in either of them than in the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said the Actor, as he put out his arm with that splendid
      gesture that we have known and admired for years, at the same time
      throwing back his leonine head so that his leonine hair fell back from his
      leonine forehead. "Not at all. I do better in both of them. My genius
      demands both tragedy and comedy at the same time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," we said, as a light broke in upon us, "then that, we presume, is the
      reason why you are about to appear in Shakespeare?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Actor frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather put it," he said, "that Shakespeare is about to appear in
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course," we murmured, ashamed of our own stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I appear," went on the Great Actor, "in <i>Hamlet</i>. I expect to
      present, I may say, an entirely new Hamlet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A new Hamlet!" we exclaimed, fascinated. "A new Hamlet! Is such a thing
      possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely," said the Great Actor, throwing his leonine head forward again.
      "I have devoted years of study to the part. The whole conception of the
      part of Hamlet has been wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All actors hitherto," continued the Great Actor, "or rather, I should
      say, all so-called actors&mdash;I mean all those who tried to act before
      me&mdash;have been entirely mistaken in their presentation. They have
      presented Hamlet as dressed in black velvet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," we interjected, "in black velvet, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. The thing is absurd," continued the Great Actor, as he reached
      down two or three heavy volumes from the shelf beside him. "Have you ever
      studied the Elizabethan era?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The which?" we asked modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Elizabethan era?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or the pre-Shakespearean tragedy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We hung our head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had, you would know that a Hamlet in black velvet is perfectly
      ridiculous. In Shakespeare's day&mdash;as I could prove in a moment if you
      had the intelligence to understand it&mdash;there was no such thing as
      black velvet. It didn't exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how then," we asked, intrigued, puzzled and yet delighted, "do <i>you</i>
      present Hamlet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In <i>brown</i> velvet," said the Great Actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Heavens," we exclaimed, "this is a revolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. But that is only one part of my conception. The main thing will be
      my presentation of what I may call the psychology of Hamlet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The psychology!" we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," resumed the Great Actor, "the psychology. To make Hamlet
      understood, I want to show him as a man bowed down by a great burden. He
      is overwhelmed with Weltschmerz. He carries in him the whole weight of the
      Zeitgeist; in fact, everlasting negation lies on him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean," we said, trying to speak as cheerfully as we could, "that
      things are a little bit too much for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His will," went on the Great Actor, disregarding our interruption, "is
      paralysed. He seeks to move in one direction and is hurled in another. One
      moment he sinks into the abyss. The next, he rises above the clouds. His
      feet seek the ground, but find only the air&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful," we said, "but will you not need a good deal of machinery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Machinery!" exclaimed the Great Actor, with a leonine laugh. "The
      machinery of <i>thought</i>, the mechanism of power, of magnetism&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," we said, "electricity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said the Great Actor. "You fail to understand. It is all
      done by my rendering. Take, for example, the famous soliloquy on death.
      You know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To be or not to be,'" we began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop," said the Great Actor. "Now observe. It is a soliloquy. Precisely.
      That is the key to it. It is something that Hamlet <i>says to himself</i>.
      Not a <i>word of it</i>, in my interpretation, is actually spoken. All is
      done in absolute, unbroken silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How on earth," we began, "can you do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely and solely <i>with my face</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heavens! Was it possible? We looked again, this time very closely, at
      the Great Actor's face. We realized with a thrill that it might be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come before the audience <i>so</i>," he went on, "and soliloquize&mdash;thus&mdash;follow
      my face, please&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Great Actor spoke, he threw himself into a characteristic pose with
      folded arms, while gust after gust of emotion, of expression, of alternate
      hope, doubt and despair, swept&mdash;we might say chased themselves across
      his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful!" we gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shakespeare's lines," said the Great Actor, as his face subsided to its
      habitual calm, "are not necessary; not, at least, with my acting. The
      lines, indeed, are mere stage directions, nothing more. I leave them out.
      This happens again and again in the play. Take, for instance, the familiar
      scene where Hamlet holds the skull in his hand: Shakespeare here suggests
      the words 'Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him well&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes!" we interrupted, in spite of ourself, "'a fellow of infinite
      jest&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your intonation is awful," said the Actor. "But listen. In my
      interpretation I use no words at all. I merely carry the skull quietly in
      my hand, very slowly, across the stage. There I lean against a pillar at
      the side, with the skull in the palm of my hand, and look at it in
      silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful!" we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I then cross over to the right of the stage, very impressively, and seat
      myself on a plain wooden bench, and remain for some time, looking at the
      skull."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marvellous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I then pass to the back of the stage and lie down on my stomach, still
      holding the skull before my eyes. After holding this posture for some
      time, I crawl slowly forward, portraying by the movement of my legs and
      stomach the whole sad history of Yorick. Finally I turn my back on the
      audience, still holding the skull, and convey through the spasmodic
      movements of my back Hamlet's passionate grief at the loss of his friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!" we exclaimed, beside ourself with excitement, "this is not merely a
      revolution, it is a revelation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it both," said the Great Actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The meaning of it is," we went on, "that you practically don't need
      Shakespeare at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, I do not. I could do better without him. Shakespeare cramps me.
      What I really mean to convey is not Shakespeare, but something greater,
      larger&mdash;how shall I express it&mdash;bigger." The Great Actor paused
      and we waited, our pencil poised in the air. Then he murmured, as his eyes
      lifted in an expression of something like rapture. "In fact&mdash;ME."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained thus, motionless, without moving. We slipped gently to our
      hands and knees and crawled quietly to the door, and so down the stairs,
      our notebook in our teeth.

    <h2>
      III WITH OUR GREATEST SCIENTIST
    </h2>
    <h3>
      As seen in any of our College Laboratories
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was among the retorts and test-tubes of his physical laboratory that we
      were privileged to interview the Great Scientist. His back was towards us
      when we entered. With characteristic modesty he kept it so for some time
      after our entry. Even when he turned round and saw us his face did not
      react off us as we should have expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to look at us, if such a thing were possible, without seeing us,
      or, at least, without wishing to see us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We handed him our card.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it, read it, dropped it in a bowlful of sulphuric acid and then,
      with a quiet gesture of satisfaction, turned again to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat for some time behind him. "This, then," we thought to ourselves (we
      always think to ourselves when we are left alone), "is the man, or rather
      is the back of the man, who has done more" (here we consulted the notes
      given us by our editor), "to revolutionize our conception of atomic
      dynamics than the back of any other man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the Great Scientist turned towards us with a sigh that seemed to
      our ears to have a note of weariness in it. Something, we felt, must be
      making him tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professor," we answered, "we have called upon you in response to an
      overwhelming demand on the part of the public&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Scientist nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To learn something of your new researches and discoveries in" (here we
      consulted a minute card which we carried in our pocket) "in
      radio-active-emanations which are already becoming" (we consulted our card
      again) "a household word&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor raised his hand as if to check us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather say," he murmured, "helio-radio-active&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So would we," we admitted, "much rather&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said the Great Scientist, "helium shares in the most intimate
      degree the properties of radium. So, too, for the matter of that," he
      added in afterthought, "do thorium, and borium!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even borium!" we exclaimed, delighted, and writing rapidly in our
      notebook. Already we saw ourselves writing up as our headline <i>Borium
      Shares Properties of Thorium</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what is it," said the Great Scientist, "that you want to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professor," we answered, "what our journal wants is a plain and simple
      explanation, so clear that even our readers can understand it, of the new
      scientific discoveries in radium. We understand that you possess, more
      than any other man, the gift of clear and lucid thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that you are able to express yourself with greater simplicity than
      any two men now lecturing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then," we said, spreading our notes on our knee, "go at it. Tell us,
      and, through us, tell a quarter of a million anxious readers just what all
      these new discoveries are about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole thing," said the Professor, warming up to his work as he
      perceived from the motions of our face and ears our intelligent interest,
      "is simplicity itself. I can give it to you in a word&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it," we said. "Give it to us that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It amounts, if one may boil it down into a phrase&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boil it, boil it," we interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amounts, if one takes the mere gist of it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it," we said, "take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amounts to the resolution of the ultimate atom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" we exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must ask you first to clear your mind," the Professor continued, "of
      all conception of ponderable magnitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      We nodded. We had already cleared our mind of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," added the Professor, with what we thought a quiet note of
      warning in his voice, "I need hardly tell you that what we are dealing
      with must be regarded as altogether ultramicroscopic."
    </p>
    <p>
      We hastened to assure the Professor that, in accordance with the high
      standards of honour represented by our journal, we should of course regard
      anything that he might say as ultramicroscopic and treat it accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say, then," we continued, "that the essence of the problem is the
      resolution of the atom. Do you think you can give us any idea of what the
      atom is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor looked at us searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked back at him, openly and frankly. The moment was critical for our
      interview. Could he do it? Were we the kind of person that he could give
      it to? Could we get it if he did?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I can," he said. "Let us begin with the assumption that the atom
      is an infinitesimal magnitude. Very good. Let us grant, then, that though
      it is imponderable and indivisible it must have a spacial content? You
      grant me this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do," we said, "we do more than this, we <i>give</i> it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. If spacial, it must have dimension: if dimension&mdash;form.
      Let us assume <i>ex hypothesi</i> the form to be that of a spheroid and
      see where it leads us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor was now intensely interested. He walked to and fro in his
      laboratory. His features worked with excitement. We worked ours, too, as
      sympathetically as we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no other possible method in inductive science," he added, "than
      to embrace some hypothesis, the most attractive that one can find, and
      remain with it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      We nodded. Even in our own humble life after our day's work we had found
      this true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the Professor, planting himself squarely in front of us,
      "assuming a spherical form, and a spacial content, assuming the dynamic
      forces that are familiar to us and assuming&mdash;the thing is bold, I
      admit&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked as bold as we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuming that the <i>ions</i>, or <i>nuclei</i> of the atom&mdash;I know
      no better word&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do we," we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the nuclei move under the energy of such forces, what have we got?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have we got? Why, the simplest matter conceivable. The forces inside
      our atom&mdash;itself, mind you, the function of a circle&mdash;mark that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      We did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Becomes merely a function of pi!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Scientist paused with a laugh of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A function of pi!" we repeated in delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely. Our conception of ultimate matter is reduced to that of an
      oblate spheroid described by the revolution of an ellipse on its own minor
      axis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" we said. "Merely that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing else. And in that case any further calculation becomes a mere
      matter of the extraction of a root."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How simple," we murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not," said the Professor. "In fact, I am accustomed, in talking to
      my class, to give them a very clear idea, by simply taking as our root F&mdash;F
      being any finite constant&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at us sharply. We nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And raising F to the log of infinity. I find they apprehend it very
      readily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they?" we murmured. Ourselves we felt as if the Log of Infinity
      carried us to ground higher than what we commonly care to tread on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said the Professor, "the Log of Infinity is an Unknown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," we said very gravely. We felt ourselves here in the presence
      of something that demanded our reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still," continued the Professor almost jauntily, "we can handle the
      Unknown just as easily as anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      This puzzled us. We kept silent. We thought it wiser to move on to more
      general ground. In any case, our notes were now nearly complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These discoveries, then," we said, "are absolutely revolutionary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are," said the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have now, as we understand, got the atom&mdash;how shall we put it?&mdash;got
      it where you want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly," said the Professor with a sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately our analysis, perfect though it is, stops short. We have no
      synthesis."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor spoke as in deep sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No synthesis," we moaned. We felt it was a cruel blow. But in any case
      our notes were now elaborate enough. We felt that our readers could do
      without a synthesis. We rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Synthetic dynamics," said the Professor, taking us by the coat, "is only
      beginning&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case&mdash;" we murmured, disengaging his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, wait, wait," he pleaded "wait for another fifty years&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will," we said very earnestly. "But meantime as our paper goes to
      press this afternoon we must go now. In fifty years we will come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see, I see," said the Professor, "you are writing all this for a
      newspaper. I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," we said, "we mentioned that at the beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the Professor, "did you? Very possibly. Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We propose," we said, "to feature the article for next Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it be long?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About two columns," we answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how much," said the Professor in a hesitating way, "do I have to pay
      you to put it in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much which?" we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do I have to pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Professor&mdash;" we began quickly. Then we checked ourselves. After
      all was it right to undeceive him, this quiet, absorbed man of science
      with his ideals, his atoms and his emanations. No, a hundred times no. Let
      him pay a hundred times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will cost you," we said very firmly, "ten dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor began groping among his apparatus. We knew that he was
      looking for his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should like also very much," we said, "to insert your picture along
      with the article&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that cost much?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that is only five dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor had meantime found his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it be all right," he began, "that is, would you mind if I pay you
      the money now? I am apt to forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite all right," we answered. We said good-bye very gently and passed
      out. We felt somehow as if we had touched a higher life. "Such," we
      murmured, as we looked about the ancient campus, "are the men of science:
      are there, perhaps, any others of them round this morning that we might
      interview?"

      IV. WITH OUR TYPICAL NOVELISTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edwin and Ethelinda Afterthought&mdash;Husband and Wife&mdash;In their
      Delightful Home Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at their beautiful country place on the Woonagansett that we had
      the pleasure of interviewing the Afterthoughts. At their own cordial
      invitation, we had walked over from the nearest railway station, a
      distance of some fourteen miles. Indeed, as soon as they heard of our
      intention they invited us to walk. "We are so sorry not to bring you in
      the motor," they wrote, "but the roads are so frightfully dusty that we
      might get dust on our chauffeur." This little touch of thoughtfulness is
      the keynote of their character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house itself is a delightful old mansion giving on a wide garden,
      which gives in turn on a broad terrace giving on the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eminent Novelist met us at the gate. We had expected to find the
      author of <i>Angela Rivers</i> and <i>The Garden of Desire</i> a pale
      aesthetic type (we have a way of expecting the wrong thing in our
      interviews). We could not resist a shock of surprise (indeed we seldom do)
      at finding him a burly out-of-door man weighting, as he himself told us, a
      hundred stone in his stockinged feet (we think he said stone).
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and see my pigs," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We wanted to ask you," we began, as we went down the walk, "something
      about your books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's look at the pigs first," he said. "Are you anything of a pig man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We are always anxious in our interviews to be all things to all men. But
      we were compelled to admit that we were not much of a pig man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the Great Novelist, "perhaps you are more of a dog man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not altogether a dog man," we answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything of a bee man?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something," we said (we were once stung by a bee).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," he said, "you shall have a go at the beehives, then, right away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We assured him that we were willing to postpone a go at the beehives till
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, then, to the styes," said the Great Novelist, and he added,
      "Perhaps you're not much of a breeder."
    </p>
    <p>
      We blushed. We thought of the five little faces around the table for which
      we provide food by writing our interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," we said, "we were not much of a breeder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," said the Great Novelist as we reached our goal, "how do you
      like this stye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much indeed," we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've put in a new tile draining&mdash;my own plan. You notice how sweet
      it keeps the stye."
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not noticed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid," said the Novelist, "that the pigs are all asleep inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      We begged him on no account to waken them. He offered to open the little
      door at the side and let us crawl in. We insisted that we could not think
      of intruding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What we would like," we said, "is to hear something of your methods of
      work in novel writing." We said this with very peculiar conviction. Quite
      apart from the immediate purposes of our interview, we have always been
      most anxious to know by what process novels are written. If we could get
      to know this, we would write one ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and see my bulls first," said the Novelist. "I've got a couple of
      young bulls here in the paddock that will interest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt sure that they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led us to a little green fence. Inside it were two ferocious looking
      animals, eating grain. They rolled their eyes upwards at us as they ate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do those strike you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assured him that they struck us as our beau ideal of bulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like to walk in beside them?" said the Novelist, opening a little gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drew back. Was it fair to disturb these bulls?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Novelist noticed our hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid," he said. "They're not likely to harm you. I send my
      hired man right in beside them every morning, without the slightest
      hesitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked at the Eminent Novelist with admiration. We realized that like
      so many of our writers, actors, and even our thinkers, of to-day, he was
      an open-air man in every sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we shook our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulls, we explained, were not a department of research for which we were
      equipped. What we wanted, we said, was to learn something of his methods
      of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My methods of work?" he answered, as we turned up the path again. "Well,
      really, I hardly know that I have any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your plan or method," we asked, getting out our notebook and
      pencil, "of laying the beginning of a new novel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My usual plan," said the Novelist, "is to come out here and sit in the
      stye till I get my characters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it take long?" we questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very. I generally find that a quiet half-hour spent among the hogs
      will give me at least my leading character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you do next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, after that I generally light a pipe and go and sit among the beehives
      looking for an incident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you get it?" we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Invariably. After that I make a few notes, then go off for a ten mile
      tramp with my esquimaux dogs, and get back in time to have a go through
      the cattle sheds and take a romp with the young bulls."
    </p>
    <p>
      We sighed. We couldn't help it. Novel writing seemed further away than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you also a goat on the premises?" we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly. A ripping old fellow&mdash;come along and see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      We shook our heads. No doubt our disappointment showed in our face. It
      often does. We felt that it was altogether right and wholesome that our
      great novels of to-day should be written in this fashion with the help of
      goats, dogs, hogs and young bulls. But we felt, too, that it was not for
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We permitted ourselves one further question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what time," we said, "do you rise in the morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh anywhere between four and five," said the Novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, and do you generally take a cold dip as soon as you are up&mdash;even
      in winter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You prefer, no doubt," we said, with a dejection that we could not
      conceal, "to have water with a good coat of ice over it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We said no more. We have long understood the reasons for our own failure
      in life, but it was painful to receive a renewed corroboration of it. This
      ice question has stood in our way for forty-seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Novelist seemed to note our dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the house," he said, "my wife will give you a cup of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments we had forgotten all our troubles in the presence of one
      of the most charming chatelaines it has been our lot to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat on a low stool immediately beside Ethelinda Afterthought, who
      presided in her own gracious fashion over the tea-urn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you want to know something of my methods of work?" she said, as she
      poured hot tea over our leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do," we answered, taking out our little book and recovering something
      of our enthusiasm. We do not mind hot tea being poured over us if people
      treat us as a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you indicate," we continued, "what method you follow in beginning one
      of your novels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always begin," said Ethelinda Afterthought, "with a study."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A study?" we queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I mean a study of actual facts. Take, for example, my <i>Leaves from
      the Life of a Steam Laundrywoman</i>&mdash;more tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to make that book I first worked two years in a laundry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years!" we exclaimed. "And why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To get the atmosphere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The steam?" we questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said Mrs. Afterthought, "I did that separately. I took a course
      in steam at a technical school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible?" we said, our heart beginning to sing again. "Was all
      that necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how one could do it otherwise. The story opens, as no doubt
      you remember&mdash;tea?&mdash;in the boiler room of the laundry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," we said, moving our leg&mdash;"no, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see the only possible <i>point d'appui</i> was to begin with a
      description of the inside of the boiler."
    </p>
    <p>
      We nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A masterly thing," we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife," interrupted the Great Novelist, who was sitting with the head
      of a huge Danish hound in his lap, sharing his buttered toast with the dog
      while he adjusted a set of trout flies, "is a great worker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you always work on that method?" we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always," she answered. "For <i>Frederica of the Factory</i> I spent six
      months in a knitting mill. For <i>Marguerite of the Mud Flats</i> I made
      special studies for months and months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what sort?" we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In mud. Learning to model it. You see for a story of that sort the first
      thing needed is a thorough knowledge of mud&mdash;all kinds of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you doing next?" we inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My next book," said the Lady Novelist, "is to be a study&mdash;tea?&mdash;of
      the pickle industry&mdash;perfectly new ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fascinating field," we murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And quite new. Several of our writers have done the slaughter-house, and
      in England a good deal has been done in jam. But so far no one has done
      pickles. I should like, if I could," added Ethelinda Afterthought, with
      the graceful modesty that is characteristic of her, "to make it the first
      of a series of pickle novels, showing, don't you know, the whole pickle
      district, and perhaps following a family of pickle workers for four or
      five generations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four or five!" we said enthusiastically. "Make it ten! And have you any
      plan for work beyond that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes indeed," laughed the Lady Novelist. "I am always planning ahead.
      What I want to do after that is a study of the inside of a penitentiary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the <i>inside</i>?" we said, with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. To do it, of course, I shall go to jail for two or three years!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you get in?" we asked, thrilled at the quiet determination of
      the frail woman before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall demand it as a right," she answered quietly. "I shall go to the
      authorities, at the head of a band of enthusiastic women, and demand that
      I shall be sent to jail. Surely after the work I have done, that much is
      coming to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly is," we said warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the novelists shook hands with us with great cordiality. Mr.
      Afterthought walked as far as the front door with us and showed us a short
      cut past the beehives that could take us directly through the bull pasture
      to the main road.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked away in the gathering darkness of evening very quietly. We made
      up our mind as we went that novel writing is not for us. We must reach the
      penitentiary in some other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we thought it well to set down our interview as a guide to others.

      IX. The New Education
    </h2>
    <p>
      "So you're going back to college in a fortnight," I said to the Bright
      Young Thing on the veranda of the summer hotel. "Aren't you sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way I am," she said, "but in another sense I'm glad to go back. One
      can't loaf all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up from her rocking-chair over her Red Cross knitting with
      great earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      How full of purpose these modern students are, I thought to myself. In my
      time we used to go back to college as to a treadmill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," I said, "but what I mean is that college, after all, is a
      pretty hard grind. Things like mathematics and Greek are no joke, are
      they? In my day, as I remember it, we used to think spherical trigonometry
      about the hardest stuff of the lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't <i>elect</i> mathematics," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," I said, "I see. So you don't have to take it. And what <i>have</i>
      you elected?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For this coming half semester&mdash;that's six weeks, you know&mdash;I've
      elected Social Endeavour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," I said, "that's since my day, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's <i>awfully</i> interesting. It's the study of conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of conditions?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All conditions. Perhaps I can't explain it properly. But I have the
      prospectus of it indoors if you'd like to see it. We take up Society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Analyse it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it must mean reading a tremendous lot of books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she answered. "We don't use books in this course. It's all
      Laboratory Work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I <i>am</i> mystified," I said. "What do you mean by Laboratory
      Work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," answered the girl student with a thoughtful look upon her face,
      "you see, we are supposed to break society up into its elements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In six weeks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of the girls do it in six weeks. Some put in a whole semester and
      take twelve weeks at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So as to break up pretty thoroughly?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she assented. "But most of the girls think six weeks is enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That ought to pulverize it pretty completely. But how do you go at it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," the girl said, "it's all done with Laboratory Work. We take, for
      instance, department stores. I think that is the first thing we do, we
      take up the department store."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We study it as a Social Germ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," I said, "as a Social Germ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the girl, delighted to see that I was beginning to understand,
      "as a Germ. All the work is done in the concrete. The class goes down with
      the professor to the department store itself&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they walk all through it, observing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But have none of them ever been in a departmental store before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course, but, you see, we go as Observers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, now, I understand. You mean you don't buy anything and so you are
      able to watch everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, "it's not that. We do buy things. That's part of it. Most
      of the girls like to buy little knick-knacks, and anyway it gives them a
      good chance to do their shopping while they're there. But while they <i>are</i>
      there they are observing. Then afterwards they make charts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charts of what?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charts of the employes; they're used to show the brain movement
      involved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you find much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said hesitatingly, "the idea is to reduce all the employes to
      a Curve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To a Curve?" I exclaimed, "an In or an Out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not exactly that. Didn't you use Curves when you were at
      college?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, nowadays nearly everything, you know, is done into a Curve. We
      put them on the board."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is this particular Curve of the employe used for?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said the student, "the idea is that from the Curve we can get the
      Norm of the employe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get his Norm?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, get the Norm. That stands for the Root Form of the employe as a
      social factor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what can you do with that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, when we have that we can tell what the employe would do under any and
      every circumstance. At least that's the idea&mdash;though I'm really only
      quoting," she added, breaking off in a diffident way, "from what Miss
      Thinker, the professor of Social Endeavour, says. She's really fine. She's
      making a general chart of the female employes of one of the biggest stores
      to show what percentage in case of fire would jump out of the window and
      what percentage would run to the fire escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a wonderful course," I said. "We had nothing like it when I went to
      college. And does it only take in departmental stores?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the girl, "the laboratory work includes for this semester
      ice-cream parlours as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you do with <i>them</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take them up as Social Cells, Nuclei, I think the professor calls
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how do you go at them?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the girls go to them in little laboratory groups and study them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They eat ice-cream in them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They <i>have to</i>," she said, "to make it concrete. But while they are
      doing it they are considering the ice-cream parlour merely as a section of
      social protoplasm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does the professor go?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, she heads each group. Professor Thinker never spares herself
      from work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," I said, "you must be kept very busy. And is Social Endeavour
      all that you are going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she answered, "I'm electing a half-course in Nature Work as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature Work? Well! Well! That, I suppose, means cramming up a lot of
      biology and zoology, does it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the girl, "it's not exactly done with books. I believe it is
      all done by Field Work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Field Work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Field Work four times a week and an Excursion every Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you do in the Field Work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girls," she answered, "go out in groups anywhere out of doors, and
      make a Nature Study of anything they see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do they do that?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, they look at it. Suppose, for example, they come to a stream or a
      pond or anything&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they <i>look</i> at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had they never done that before?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but they look at it as a Nature Unit. Each girl must take forty units
      in the course. I think we only do one unit each day we go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must," I said, "be pretty fatiguing work, and what about the
      Excursion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's every Saturday. We go out with Miss Stalk, the professor of
      Ambulation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where do you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, anywhere. One day we go perhaps for a trip on a steamer and another
      Saturday somewhere in motors, and so on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing what?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Field Work. The aim of the course&mdash;I'm afraid I'm quoting Miss Stalk
      but I don't mind, she's really fine&mdash;is to break nature into its
      elements&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So as to view it as the external structure of Society and make deductions
      from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you made any?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"I'm only starting the work this term.
      But, of course, I shall have to. Each girl makes at least one deduction at
      the end of the course. Some of the seniors make two or three. But you have
      to make <i>one</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a great course," I said. "No wonder you are going to be busy; and,
      as you say, how much better than loafing round here doing nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it?" said the girl student with enthusiasm in her eyes. "It gives
      one such a sense of purpose, such a feeling of doing something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, goodness," she exclaimed, "there's the lunch bell. I must skip and
      get ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just vanishing from my side when the Burly Male Student, who was
      also staying in the hotel, came puffing up after his five-mile run. He was
      getting himself into trim for enlistment, so he told me. He noted the
      retreating form of the college girl as he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just been talking to her," I said, "about her college work. She
      seems to be studying a queer lot of stuff&mdash;Social Endeavour and all
      that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awful piffle," said the young man. "But the girls naturally run to all
      that sort of rot, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, your work," I went on, "is no doubt very different. I mean what you
      were taking before the war came along. I suppose you fellows have an awful
      dose of mathematics and philology and so on just as I did in my college
      days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like a blush came across the face of the handsome youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no," he said, "I didn't co-opt mathematics. At our college, you
      know, we co-opt two majors and two minors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," I said, "and what were you co-opting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I co-opted Turkish, Music, and Religion," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," I said with a sort of reverential respect, "fitting yourself
      for a position of choir-master in a Turkish cathedral, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," he said, "I'm going into insurance; but, you see, those subjects
      fitted in better than anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fitted in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Turkish comes at nine, music at ten and religion at eleven. So they
      make a good combination; they leave a man free to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To develop his mind," I said. "We used to find in my college days that
      lectures interfered with it badly. But now, Turkish, that must be an
      interesting language, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Search me!" said the student. "All you have to do is answer the roll and
      go out. Forty roll-calls give you one Turkish unit&mdash;but, say, I must
      get on, I've got to change. So long."
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help reflecting, as the young man left me, on the great
      changes that have come over our college education. It was a relief to me
      later in the day to talk with a quiet, sombre man, himself a graduate
      student in philosophy, on this topic. He agreed with me that the old
      strenuous studies seem to be very largely abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the sombre man with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now your work," I said, "is very different from what these young people
      are doing&mdash;hard, solid, definite effort. What a relief it must be to
      you to get a brief vacation up here. I couldn't help thinking to-day, as I
      watched you moving round doing nothing, how fine it must feel for you to
      come up here after your hard work and put in a month of out-and-out
      loafing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loafing!" he said indignantly. "I'm not loafing. I'm putting in a half
      summer course in Introspection. That's why I'm here. I get credit for two
      majors for my time here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," I said, as gently as I could, "you get credit here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me. I am still pondering over our new education. Meantime I think
      I shall enter my little boy's name on the books of Tuskegee College where
      the education is still old-fashioned.

    <h2>
      X. The Errors of Santa Claus
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Christmas Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Browns, who lived in the adjoining house, had been dining with the
      Joneses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown and Jones were sitting over wine and walnuts at the table. The
      others had gone upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you giving to your boy for Christmas?" asked Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A train," said Jones, "new kind of thing&mdash;automatic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have a look at it," said Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones fetched a parcel from the sideboard and began unwrapping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ingenious thing, isn't it?" he said. "Goes on its own rails. Queer how
      kids love to play with trains, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," assented Brown. "How are the rails fixed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, I'll show you," said Jones. "Just help me to shove these dinner
      things aside and roll back the cloth. There! See! You lay the rails like
      that and fasten them at the ends, so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I catch on, makes a grade, doesn't it? Just the thing to amuse a
      child, isn't it? I got Willy a toy aeroplane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, they're great. I got Edwin one on his birthday. But I thought I'd
      get him a train this time. I told him Santa Claus was going to bring him
      something altogether new this time. Edwin, of course, believes in Santa
      Claus absolutely. Say, look at this locomotive, would you? It has a spring
      coiled up inside the fire box."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wind her up," said Brown with great interest. "Let's see her go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Jones. "Just pile up two or three plates or something to
      lean the end of the rails on. There, notice the way it buzzes before it
      starts. Isn't that a great thing for a kid, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Brown. "And say, see this little string to pull the whistle!
      By Gad, it toots, eh? Just like real?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, Brown," Jones went on, "you hitch on those cars and I'll start
      her. I'll be engineer, eh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Brown and Jones were still playing trains on the
      dining-room table.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their wives upstairs in the drawing-room hardly noticed their absence.
      They were too much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think it's perfectly sweet," said Mrs. Brown. "Just the loveliest
      doll I've seen in years. I must get one like it for Ulvina. Won't Clarisse
      be perfectly enchanted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered Mrs. Jones, "and then she'll have all the fun of arranging
      the dresses. Children love that so much. Look, there are three little
      dresses with the doll, aren't they cute? All cut out and ready to stitch
      together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how perfectly lovely!" exclaimed Mrs. Brown. "I think the mauve one
      would suit the doll best, don't you, with such golden hair? Only don't you
      think it would make it much nicer to turn back the collar, so, and to put
      a little band&mdash;so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>What</i> a good idea!" said Mrs. Jones. "Do let's try it. Just wait,
      I'll get a needle in a minute. I'll tell Clarisse that Santa Claus sewed
      it himself. The child believes in Santa Claus absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      And half an hour later Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Brown were so busy stitching
      dolls' clothes that they could not hear the roaring of the little train up
      and down the dining table, and had no idea what the four children were
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the children miss their mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dandy, aren't they?" Edwin Jones was saying to little Willie Brown, as
      they sat in Edwin's bedroom. "A hundred in a box, with cork tips, and see,
      an amber mouthpiece that fits into a little case at the side. Good present
      for Dad, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine!" said Willie appreciatively. "I'm giving Father cigars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, I thought of cigars too. Men always like cigars and cigarettes.
      You can't go wrong on them. Say, would you like to try one or two of these
      cigarettes? We can take them from the bottom. You'll like them, they're
      Russian&mdash;away ahead of Egyptian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," answered Willie. "I'd like one immensely. I only started smoking
      last spring&mdash;on my twelfth birthday. I think a feller's a fool to
      begin smoking cigarettes too soon, don't you? It stunts him. I waited till
      I was twelve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me too," said Edwin, as they lighted their cigarettes. "In fact, I
      wouldn't buy them now if it weren't for Dad. I simply <i>had</i> to give
      him something from Santa Claus. He believes in Santa Claus absolutely, you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, while this was going on, Clarisse was showing little Ulvina the
      absolutely lovely little bridge set that she got for her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't these markers perfectly charming?" said Ulvina. "And don't you
      love this little Dutch design&mdash;or is it Flemish, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dutch," said Clarisse. "Isn't it quaint? And aren't these the dearest
      little things, for putting the money in when you play. I needn't have got
      them with it&mdash;they'd have sold the rest separately&mdash;but I think
      it's too utterly slow playing without money, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, abominable," shuddered Ulvina. "But your mamma never plays for money,
      does she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma! Oh, gracious, no. Mamma's far too slow for that. But I shall tell
      her that Santa Claus insisted on putting in the little money boxes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she believes in Santa Claus, just as my mamma does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, absolutely," said Clarisse, and added, "What if we play a little
      game! With a double dummy, the French way, or Norwegian Skat, if you like.
      That only needs two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," agreed Ulvina, and in a few minutes they were deep in a game
      of cards with a little pile of pocket money beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half an hour later, all the members of the two families were again
      in the drawing-room. But of course nobody said anything about the
      presents. In any case they were all too busy looking at the beautiful big
      Bible, with maps in it, that the Joneses had brought to give to
      Grandfather. They all agreed that, with the help of it, Grandfather could
      hunt up any place in Palestine in a moment, day or night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But upstairs, away upstairs in a sitting-room of his own Grandfather Jones
      was looking with an affectionate eye at the presents that stood beside
      him. There was a beautiful whisky decanter, with silver filigree outside
      (and whiskey inside) for Jones, and for the little boy a big nickel-plated
      Jew's harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, far in the night, the person, or the influence, or whatever it
      is called Santa Claus, took all the presents and placed them in the
      people's stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, being blind as he always has been, he gave the wrong things to the
      wrong people&mdash;in fact, he gave them just as indicated above.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day, in the course of Christmas morning, the situation
      straightened itself out, just as it always does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, by ten o'clock, Brown and Jones were playing with the train, and
      Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Jones were making dolls' clothes, and the boys were
      smoking cigarettes, and Clarisse and Ulvina were playing cards for their
      pocket-money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And upstairs&mdash;away up&mdash;Grandfather was drinking whisky and
      playing the Jew's harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Christmas, just as it always does, turned out all right after all.

      XI. Lost in New York
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A VISITOR'S SOLILOQUY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Well! Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever has been happening to this place, to New York? Changed? Changed
      since I was here in '86? Well, I should say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hack-driver of the old days that I used to find waiting for me at the
      station curb, with that impossible horse of his&mdash;the hack-driver with
      his bulbous red face, and the nice smell of rye whisky all 'round him for
      yards&mdash;gone, so it seems, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in place of him this&mdash;what is it they call it?&mdash;taxi, with a
      clean-shaven cut-throat steering it. "Get in," he says, Just that. He
      doesn't offer to help me or lift my satchel. All right, young man, I'm
      crawling in.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the machine that marks it, eh? I suppose they have them rigged up
      so they can punch up anything they like. I thought so&mdash;he hits it up
      to fifty cents before we start. But I saw him do it. Well, I can stand for
      it this time. I'll not be caught in one of these again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel? All right, I'm getting out. My hotel? But what is it they have
      done to it? They must have added ten stories to it. It reaches to the sky.
      But I'll not try to look to the top of it. Not with this satchel in my
      hand: no, sir! I'll wait till I'm safe inside. In there I'll feel all
      right. They'll know me in there. They'll remember right away my visit in
      the fall of '86. They won't easily have forgotten that big dinner I gave&mdash;nine
      people at a dollar fifty a plate, with the cigars extra. The clerk will
      remember <i>me</i>, all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Know me? Not they. The <i>clerk</i> know me! How could he? For it seems
      now there isn't any clerk, or not as there used to be. They have
      subdivided him somehow into five or six. There is a man behind a desk, a
      majestic sort of man, waving his hand. It would be sheer madness to claim
      acquaintance with him. There is another with a great book, adjusting cards
      in it; and another, behind glass labelled "Cashier," and busy as a bank;
      there are two with mail and telegrams. They are all too busy to know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I sneak up near to them, keeping my satchel in my hand? I wonder, do
      they <i>see</i> me? <i>Can</i> they see me, a mere thing like me? I am
      within ten feet of them, but I am certain that they cannot see me. I am,
      and I feel it, absolutely invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ha! One has seen me. He turns to me, or rather he rounds upon me, with the
      words "Well, sir?" That, and nothing else, sharp and hard. There is none
      of the ancient kindly pretence of knowing my name, no reaching out a
      welcome hand and calling me Mr. Er&mdash;Er&mdash;till he has read my name
      upside down while I am writing it and can address me as a familiar friend.
      No friendly questioning about the crops in my part of the country. The
      crops, forsooth! What do these young men know about crops?
    </p>
    <p>
      A room? Had I any reservation? Any which? Any reservation. Oh, I see, had
      I written down from home to say that I was coming? No, I had not because
      the truth is I came at very short notice. I didn't know till a week before
      that my brother-in-law&mdash;He is not listening. He has moved away. I
      will stand and wait till he comes back. I am intruding here; I had no
      right to disturb these people like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I can have a room at eleven o'clock. When it is which?&mdash;is
      vacated. Oh, yes, I see, when the man in it gets up and goes away. I
      didn't for the minute catch on to what the word&mdash;He has stopped
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind, I can wait. From eight to eleven is only three hours, anyway.
      I will move about here and look at things. If I keep moving they will
      notice me less. Ha! books and news papers and magazines&mdash;what a stack
      of them! Like a regular book-store. I will stand here and take a look at
      some of them. Eh! what's that? Did I want to <i>buy</i> anything? Well,
      no, I hadn't exactly&mdash;I was just&mdash;Oh, I see, they're on <i>sale</i>.
      All right, yes, give me this one&mdash;fifty cents&mdash;all right&mdash;and
      this and these others. That's all right, miss, I'm not stingy. They always
      say of me up in our town that when I&mdash;She has stopped listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind. I will walk up and down again with the magazines under my arm.
      That will make people think I live here. Better still if I could put the
      magazines in my satchel. But how? There is no way to set it down and undo
      the straps. I wonder if I could dare put it for a minute on that table,
      the polished one&mdash;? Or no, they wouldn't likely allow a man to put a
      bag <i>there</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I can wait. Anyway, it's eight o'clock and soon, surely, breakfast
      will be ready. As soon as I hear the gong I can go in there. I wonder if I
      could find out first where the dining-room is. It used always to be marked
      across the door, but I don't seem to see it. Darn it, I'll ask that man in
      uniform. If I'm here prepared to spend my good money to get breakfast I
      guess I'm not scared to ask a simple question of a man in uniform. Or no,
      I'll not ask <i>him</i>. I'll try this one&mdash;or no, he's busy. I'll
      ask this other boy. Say, would you mind, if you please, telling me,
      please, which way the dining-room&mdash;Eh, what? Do I want which? The
      grill room or the palm room? Why, I tell you, young man, I just wanted to
      get some breakfast if it's&mdash;what? Do I want what? I didn't quite get
      that&mdash;<i>a la carte</i>? No, thanks&mdash;and, what's that? table de
      what? in the palm room? No, I just wanted&mdash;but it doesn't matter.
      I'll wait 'round here and look about till I hear the gong. Don't worry
      about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's that? What's that boy shouting out&mdash;that boy with the tray? A
      call for Mr. Something or Other&mdash;say, must be something happened
      pretty serious! A call for Mr.&mdash;why, that's for me! Hullo! <i>Here I
      am! Here, it's Me! Here I am</i>&mdash;wanted at the desk? all right, I'm
      coming, I'm hurrying. I guess something's wrong at home, eh! <i>Here I am</i>.
      That's my name. I'm ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, a room. You've got a room for me. All right. The fifteenth floor! Good
      heavens! Away up there! Never mind, I'll take it. Can't give me a bath?
      That's all right. I had one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elevator over this way? All right, I'll come along. Thanks, I can carry
      it. But I don't see any elevator? Oh, this door in the wall? Well! I'm
      hanged. This the elevator! It certainly has changed. The elevator that I
      remember had a rope in the middle of it, and you pulled the rope up as you
      went, wheezing and clanking all the way to the fifth floor. But this looks
      a queer sort of machine. How do you do&mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon. I was
      in the road of the door, I guess. Excuse me, I'm afraid I got in the way
      of your elbow. It's all right, you didn't hurt&mdash;or, not bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gee whiz! It goes fast. Are you sure you can stop it? Better be careful,
      young man. There was an elevator once in our town that&mdash;fifteenth
      floor? All right.
    </p>
    <p>
      This room, eh! Great Scott, it's high up. Say, better not go too near that
      window, boy. That would be a hell of a drop if a feller fell out. You
      needn't wait. Oh, I see. I beg your pardon. I suppose a quarter is enough,
      eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it's a relief to be alone. But say, this is high up! And what a
      noise! What is it they're doing out there, away out in the air, with all
      that clatter&mdash;building a steel building, I guess. Well, those fellers
      have their nerve, all right. I'll sit further back from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's lonely up here. In the old days I could have rung a bell and had a
      drink sent up to the room; but away up here on the fifteenth floor! Oh,
      no, they'd never send a drink clean up to the fifteenth floor. Of course,
      in the old days, I could have put on my canvas slippers and walked down to
      the bar and had a drink and talked to the bar-tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course they wouldn't have a bar in a place like this. I'd like to
      go down and see, but I don't know that I'd care to ask, anyway. No, I
      guess I'll just sit and wait. Some one will come for me, I guess, after a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were back right now in our town, I could walk into Ed Clancey's
      restaurant and have ham and eggs, or steak and eggs, or anything, for
      thirty-five cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our town up home is a peach of a little town, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say, I just feel as if I'd like to take my satchel and jump clean out of
      that window. It would be a good rebuke to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, pshaw! what would <i>they</i> care?

    <h2>
      XII. This Strenuous Age
    </h2>
    <p>
      Something is happening, I regret to find, to the world in which we used to
      live. The poor old thing is being "speeded up." There is "efficiency" in
      the air. Offices open at eight o'clock. Millionaires lunch on a baked
      apple. Bankers eat practically nothing. A college president has declared
      that there are more foot pounds of energy in a glass of peptonized milk
      than in&mdash;something else, I forget what. All this is very fine. Yet
      somehow I feel out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends are failing me. They won't sit up after midnight. They have
      taken to sleeping out of doors, on porches and pergolas. Some, I
      understand, merely roost on plain wooden bars. They rise early. They take
      deep breathing. They bathe in ice water. They are no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change I am sure, is excellent. It is, I am certain, just as it ought
      to be. I am merely saying, quietly and humbly, that I am not in it. I am
      being left behind. Take, for example, the case of alcohol. That, at least,
      is what it is called now. There were days when we called it Bourbon whisky
      and Tom Gin, and when the very name of it breathed romance. That time is
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor stuff is now called alcohol, and none so low that he has a good
      word for it. Quite right, I am certain. I don't defend it. Alcohol, they
      are saying to-day, if taken in sufficient quantities, tears all the outer
      coating off the diaphragm. It leaves the epigastric tissue, so I am
      informed, a useless wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I don't deny. It gets, they tell me, into the brain. I don't dispute
      it. It turns the prosencephalon into mere punk. I know it. I've felt it
      doing it. They tell me&mdash;and I believe it&mdash;that after even one
      glass of alcohol, or shall we say Scotch whisky and soda, a man's working
      power is lowered by twenty per cent. This is a dreadful thing. After three
      glasses, so it is held, his capacity for sustained rigid thought is cut in
      two. And after about six glasses the man's working power is reduced by at
      least a hundred per cent. He merely sits there&mdash;in his arm-chair, at
      his club let us say&mdash;with all power, even all <i>desire</i> to work
      gone out of him, not thinking rigidly, not sustaining his thought, a mere
      shapeless chunk of geniality, half hidden in the blue smoke of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very dreadful, not a doubt. Alcohol is doomed; it is going it is gone. Yet
      when I think of a hot Scotch on a winter evening, or a Tom Collins on a
      summer morning, or a gin Rickey beside a tennis-court, or a stein of beer
      on a bench beside a bowling-green&mdash;I wish somehow that we could
      prohibit the use of alcohol and merely drink beer and whisky and gin as we
      used to. But these things, it appears, interfere with work. They have got
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But turn to the broader and simpler question of <i>work</i> itself. In my
      time one hated it. It was viewed as the natural enemy of man. Now the
      world has fallen in love with it. My friends, I find, take their deep
      breathing and their porch sleeping because it makes them work better. They
      go for a week's vacation in Virginia not for its own sake, but because
      they say they can work better when they get back. I know a man who wears
      very loose boots because he can work better in them: and another who wears
      only soft shirts because he can work better in a soft shirt. There are
      plenty of men now who would wear dog-harness if they thought they could
      work more in it. I know another man who walks away out into the country
      every Sunday: not that he likes the country&mdash;he wouldn't recognize a
      bumble bee if he saw it&mdash;but he claims that if he walks on Sunday his
      head is as clear as a bell for work on Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against work itself, I say nothing. But I sometimes wonder if I stand
      alone in this thing. Am I the <i>only</i> person left who hates it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is work all. Take food. I admit, here and now, that the lunch I like
      best&mdash;I mean for an ordinary plain lunch, not a party&mdash;is a beef
      steak about one foot square and two inches thick. Can I work on it? No, I
      can't, but I can work in spite of it. That is as much as one used to ask,
      twenty-five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now I find that all my friends boast ostentatiously about the meagre
      lunch they eat. One tells me that he finds a glass of milk and a prune is
      quite as much as he cares to take. Another says that a dry biscuit and a
      glass of water is all that his brain will stand. One lunches on the white
      of an egg. Another eats merely the yolk. I have only two friends left who
      can eat a whole egg at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that the fear of these men is that if they eat more than an
      egg or a biscuit they will feel heavy after lunch. Why they object to
      feeling heavy, I do not know. Personally, I enjoy it. I like nothing
      better than to sit round after a heavy lunch with half a dozen heavy
      friends, smoking heavy cigars. I am well aware that that is wicked. I
      merely confess the fact. I do not palliate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is food all, nor drink, nor work, nor open air. There has spread
      abroad along with the so-called physical efficiency a perfect passion for
      <i>information</i>. Somehow if a man's stomach is empty and his head clear
      as a bell, and if he won't drink and won't smoke, he reaches out for
      information. He wants facts. He reads the newspapers all though, instead
      of only reading the headings. He clamours for articles filled with
      statistics about illiteracy and alien immigration and the number of
      battleships in the Japanese navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know quite a lot of men who have actually bought the new <i>Encyclopaedia
      Britannica</i>. What is more, they <i>read</i> the thing. They sit in
      their apartments at night with a glass of water at their elbow reading the
      encyclopaedia. They say that it is literally filled with facts. Other men
      spend their time reading the Statistical Abstract of the United States
      (they say the figures in it are great) and the Acts of Congress, and the
      list of Presidents since Washington (or was it Washington?).
    </p>
    <p>
      Spending their evenings thus, and topping it off with a cold baked apple,
      and sleeping out in the snow, they go to work in the morning, so they tell
      me, with a positive sense of exhilaration. I have no doubt that they do.
      But, for me, I confess that once and for all I am out of it. I am left
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add to it all such rising dangers as total prohibition, and the female
      franchise, the daylight saving, and eugenic marriage, together with
      proportional representation, the initiative and the referendum, and the
      duty of the citizen to take an intelligent interest in politics&mdash;and
      I admit that I shall not be sorry to go away from here.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before I <i>do</i> go, I have one hope. I understand that down in
      Hayti things are very different. Bull fights, cock fights, dog fights, are
      openly permitted. Business never begins till eleven in the morning.
      Everybody sleeps after lunch, and the bars remain open all night. Marriage
      is but a casual relation. In fact, the general condition of morality, so
      they tell me, is lower in Hayti than it has been anywhere since the time
      of Nero. Me for Hayti.

    <h2>
      XIII. The Old, Old Story of How Five Men Went Fishing
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a plain account of a fishing party. It is not a story. There is no
      plot. Nothing happens in it and nobody is hurt. The only point of this
      narrative is its peculiar truth. It not only tells what happened to us&mdash;the
      five people concerned in it&mdash;but what has happened and is happening
      to all the other fishing parties that at the season of the year, from
      Halifax to Idaho, go gliding out on the unruffled surface of our Canadian
      and American lakes in the still cool of early summer morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided to go in the early morning because there is a popular belief
      that the early morning is the right time for bass fishing. The bass is
      said to bite in the early morning. Perhaps it does. In fact the thing is
      almost capable of scientific proof. The bass does <i>not</i> bite between
      eight and twelve. It does <i>not</i> bite between twelve and six in the
      afternoon. Nor does it bite between six o'clock and midnight. All these
      things are known facts. The inference is that the bass bites furiously at
      about daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate our party were unanimous about starting early. "Better make an
      early start," said the Colonel, when the idea of the party was suggested.
      "Oh, yes," said George Popley, the bank manager, "we want to get right out
      on the shoal while the fish are biting."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said this all our eyes glistened. Everybody's do. There's a thrill
      in the words. To "get right out on the shoal at daybreak when the fish are
      biting," is an idea that goes to any man's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you listen to the men talking in a Pullman car, or an hotel corridor,
      or, better still, at the little tables in a first-class bar, you will not
      listen long before you hear one say: "Well, we got out early, just after
      sunrise, right on the shoal." And presently, even if you can't hear him,
      you will see him reach out his two hands and hold them about two feet
      apart for the other man to admire. He is measuring the fish. No, not the
      fish they caught; this was the big one that they lost. But they had him
      right up to the top of the water. Oh, yes, he was up to the top of the
      water all right. The number of huge fish that have been heaved up to the
      top of the water in our lakes is almost incredible. Or at least it used to
      be when we still had bar rooms and little tables for serving that vile
      stuff Scotch whisky and such foul things as gin Rickeys and John
      Collinses. It makes one sick to think of it, doesn't it? But there was
      good fishing in the bars, all the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as I say, we decided to go early in the morning. Charlie Jones, the
      railroad man, said that he remembered how when he was a boy, up in
      Wisconsin, they used to get out at five in the morning&mdash;not get up at
      five but be on the shoal at five. It appears that there is a shoal
      somewhere in Wisconsin where the bass lie in thousands. Kernin, the
      lawyer, said that when he was a boy&mdash;this was on Lake Rosseau&mdash;they
      used to get out at four. It seems there is a shoal in Lake Rosseau where
      you can haul up the bass as fast as you can drop your line. The shoal is
      hard to find&mdash;very hard. Kernin can find it, but it is doubtful&mdash;so
      I gather&mdash;if any other living man can. The Wisconsin shoal, too, is
      very difficult to find. Once you find it, you are all right; but it's hard
      to find. Charlie Jones can find it. If you were in Wisconsin right now
      he'd take you straight to it, but probably no other person now alive could
      reach that shoal. In the same way Colonel Morse knows of a shoal in Lake
      Simcoe where he used to fish years and years ago and which, I understand,
      he can still find.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have mentioned that Kernin is a lawyer, and Jones a railroad man and
      Popley a banker. But I needn't have. Any reader would take it for granted.
      In any fishing party there is always a lawyer. You can tell him at sight.
      He is the one of the party that has a landing net and a steel rod in
      sections with a wheel that is used to wind the fish to the top of the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there is always a banker. You can tell him by his good clothes.
      Popley, in the bank, wears his banking suit. When he goes fishing he wears
      his fishing suit. It is much the better of the two, because his banking
      suit has ink marks on it, and his fishing suit has no fish marks on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the railroad man&mdash;quite so, the reader knows it as well as I
      do&mdash;you can tell him because he carries a pole that he cut in the
      bush himself, with a ten-cent line wrapped round the end of it. Jones says
      he can catch as many fish with this kind of line as Kernin can with his
      patent rod and wheel. So he can too. Just the same number.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kernin says that with his patent apparatus if you get a fish on you
      can <i>play</i> him. Jones says to Hades with <i>playing</i> him: give him
      a fish on his line and he'll haul him in all right. Kernin says he'd lose
      him. But Jones says <i>he</i> wouldn't. In fact he <i>guarantees</i> to
      haul the fish in. Kernin says that more than once&mdash;in Lake Rosseau&mdash;he
      has played a fish for over half an hour. I forget now why he stopped; I
      think the fish quit playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard Kernin and Jones argue this question of their two rods, as to
      which rod can best pull in the fish, for half an hour. Others may have
      heard the same question debated. I know no way by which it could be
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our arrangement to go fishing was made at the little golf club of our
      summer town on the veranda where we sit in the evening. Oh, it's just a
      little place, nothing pretentious: the links are not much good for <i>golf</i>;
      in fact we don't play much <i>golf</i> there, so far as golf goes, and of
      course, we don't serve meals at the club, it's not like that&mdash;and no,
      we've nothing to drink there because of prohibition. But we go and <i>sit</i>
      there. It is a good place to <i>sit</i>, and, after all, what else can you
      do in the present state of the law?
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was there that we arranged the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing somehow seemed to fall into the mood of each of us. Jones said
      he had been hoping that some of the boys would get up a fishing party. It
      was apparently the one kind of pleasure that he really cared for. For
      myself I was delighted to get in with a crowd of regular fishermen like
      these four, especially as I hadn't been out fishing for nearly ten years,
      though fishing is a thing I am passionately fond of. I know no pleasure in
      life like the sensation of getting a four-pound bass on the hook and
      hauling him up to the top of the water, to weigh him. But, as I say, I
      hadn't been out for ten years. Oh, yes, I live right beside the water
      every summer, and yes, certainly&mdash;I am saying so&mdash;I am
      passionately fond of fishing, but still somehow I hadn't been <i>out</i>.
      Every fisherman knows just how that happens. The years have a way of
      slipping by. Yet I must say I was surprised to find that so keen a sport
      as Jones hadn't been out&mdash;so it presently appeared&mdash;for eight
      years. I had imagined he practically lived on the water. And Colonel Morse
      and Kernin, I was amazed to find, hadn't been out for twelve years, not
      since the day&mdash;so it came out in conversation&mdash;when they went
      out together in Lake Rosseau and Kernin landed a perfect monster, a
      regular corker, five pounds and a half, they said; or no, I don't think he
      <i>landed</i> him. No, I remember, he didn't <i>land</i> him. He caught
      him&mdash;and he <i>could</i> have landed him, he should have landed him&mdash;but
      he <i>didn't</i> land him. That was it. Yes, I remember Kernin and Morse
      had a slight discussion about it&mdash;oh, perfectly amicable&mdash;as to
      whether Morse had fumbled with the net or whether Kernin&mdash;the whole
      argument was perfectly friendly&mdash;had made an ass of himself by not
      "striking" soon enough. Of course the whole thing was so long ago that
      both of them could look back on it without any bitterness or ill nature.
      In fact it amused them. Kernin said it was the most laughable thing he
      ever saw in his life to see poor old Jack&mdash;that's Morse's name&mdash;shoving
      away with the landing net wrong side up. And Morse said he'd never forget
      seeing poor old Kernin yanking his line first this way and then that and
      not knowing where to try to haul it. It made him laugh to look back at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They might have gone on laughing for quite a time, but Charlie Jones
      interrupted by saying that in his opinion a landing net is a piece of
      darned foolishness. Here Popley agrees with him. Kernin objects that if
      you don't use a net you'll lose your fish at the side of the boat. Jones
      says no: give him a hook well through the fish and a stout line in his
      hand and that fish has <i>got</i> to come in. Popley says so too. He says
      let him have his hook fast through the fish's head with a short stout
      line, and put him (Popley) at the other end of that line and that fish
      will come in. It's <i>got</i> to. Otherwise Popley will know why. That's
      the alternative. Either the fish must come in or Popley must know why.
      There's no escape from the logic of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps some of my readers have heard the thing discussed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as I say, we decided to go the next morning and to make an early
      start. All of the boys were at one about that. When I say "boys," I use
      the word, as it is used in fishing, to mean people from say forty-five to
      sixty-five. There is something about fishing that keeps men young. If a
      fellow gets out for a good morning's fishing, forgetting all business
      worries, once in a while&mdash;say, once in ten years&mdash;it keeps him
      fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      We agreed to go in a launch, a large launch&mdash;to be exact, the largest
      in the town. We could have gone in row boats, but a row boat is a poor
      thing to fish from. Kernin said that in a row boat it is impossible
      properly to "<i>play</i>" your fish. The side of the boat is so low that
      the fish is apt to leap over the side into the boat when half "played."
      Popley said that there is no comfort in a row boat. In a launch a man can
      reach out his feet and take it easy. Charlie Jones said that in a launch a
      man could rest his back against something, and Morse said that in a launch
      a man could rest his neck. Young inexperienced boys, in the small sense of
      the word, never think of these things. So they go out and after a few
      hours their necks get tired; whereas a group of expert fishers in a launch
      can rest their backs and necks and even fall asleep during the pauses when
      the fish stop biting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway all the "boys" agreed that the great advantage of a launch would be
      that we could get a <i>man</i> to take us. By that means the man could see
      to getting the worms, and the man would be sure to have spare lines, and
      the man could come along to our different places&mdash;we were all beside
      the water&mdash;and pick us up. In fact the more we thought about the
      advantage of having a "man" to take us the better we liked it. As a boy
      gets old he likes to have a man around to do the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway Frank Rolls, the man we decided to get, not only has the biggest
      launch in town but what is more Frank <i>knows</i> the lake. We called him
      up at his boat-house over the phone and said we'd give him five dollars to
      take us out first thing in the morning provided that he knew the shoal. He
      said he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, to be quite candid about it, who mentioned whisky first. In
      these days everybody has to be a little careful. I imagine we had all been
      <i>thinking</i> whisky for some time before anybody said it. But there is
      a sort of convention that when men go fishing they must have whisky. Each
      man makes the pretence that one thing he needs at six o'clock in the
      morning is cold raw whisky. It is spoken of in terms of affection. One man
      says the first thing you need if you're going fishing is a good "snort" of
      whisky; another says that a good "snifter" is the very thing; and the
      others agree that no man can fish properly without "a horn," or a "bracer"
      or an "eye-opener." Each man really decides that he himself won't take
      any. But he feels that, in a collective sense, the "boys" need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was with us. The Colonel said he'd bring along "a bottle of booze."
      Popley said, no, let <i>him</i> bring it; Kernin said let him; and Charlie
      Jones said no, he'd bring it. It turned out that the Colonel had some very
      good Scotch at his house that he'd like to bring; oddly enough Popley had
      some good Scotch in <i>his</i> house too; and, queer though it is, each of
      the boys had Scotch in his house. When the discussion closed we knew that
      each of the five of us was intending to bring a bottle of whisky. Each of
      the five of us expected the other to drink one and a quarter bottles in
      the course of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose we must have talked on that veranda till long after one in the
      morning. It was probably nearer two than one when we broke up. But we
      agreed that that made no difference. Popley said that for him three hours'
      sleep, the right kind of sleep, was far more refreshing than ten. Kernin
      said that a lawyer learns to snatch his sleep when he can, and Jones said
      that in railroad work a man pretty well cuts out sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we had no alarms whatever about not being ready by five. Our plan was
      simplicity itself. Men like ourselves in responsible positions learn to
      organize things easily. In fact Popley says it is that faculty that has
      put us where we are. So the plan simply was that Frank Rolls should come
      along at five o'clock and blow his whistle in front of our places, and at
      that signal each man would come down to his wharf with his rod and kit and
      so we'd be off to the shoal without a moment's delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather we ruled out. It was decided that even if it rained that made
      no difference. Kernin said that fish bite better in the rain. And
      everybody agreed that man with a couple of snorts in him need have no fear
      of a little rain water.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we parted, all keen on the enterprise. Nor do I think even now that
      there was anything faulty or imperfect in that party as we planned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard Frank Rolls blowing his infernal whistle opposite my summer
      cottage at some ghastly hour in the morning. Even without getting out of
      bed, I could see from the window that it was no day for fishing. No, not
      raining exactly. I don't mean that, but one of those peculiar days&mdash;I
      don't mean <i>wind</i>&mdash;there was no wind, but a sort of feeling in
      the air that showed anybody who understands bass fishing that it was a
      perfectly rotten day for going out. The fish, I seemed to know it,
      wouldn't bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was still fretting over the annoyance of the disappointment I heard
      Frank Rolls blowing his whistle in front of the other cottages. I counted
      thirty whistles altogether. Then I fell into a light doze&mdash;not
      exactly sleep, but a sort of <i>doze</i>&mdash;I can find no other word
      for it. It was clear to me that the other "boys" had thrown the thing
      over. There was no use in my trying to go out alone. I stayed where I was,
      my doze lasting till ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I walked up town later in the morning I couldn't help being struck by
      the signs in the butcher's shops and the restaurants, FISH, FRESH FISH,
      FRESH LAKE FISH.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where in blazes do they get those fish anyway?

      XIV. Back from the Land
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have just come back now with the closing in of autumn&mdash;to the city.
      I have hung up my hoe in my study; my spade is put away behind the piano.
      I have with me seven pounds of Paris Green that I had over. Anybody who
      wants it may have it. I didn't like to bury it for fear of its poisoning
      the ground. I didn't like to throw it away for fear of its destroying
      cattle. I was afraid to leave it in my summer place for fear that it might
      poison the tramps who generally break in in November. I have it with me
      now. I move it from room to room, as I hate to turn my back upon it.
      Anybody who wants it, I repeat, can have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like also to give away, either to the Red Cross or to anything
      else, ten packets of radish seed (the early curled variety, I think),
      fifteen packets of cucumber seed (the long succulent variety, I believe it
      says), and twenty packets of onion seed (the Yellow Danvers,
      distinguished, I understand, for its edible flavour and its nutritious
      properties). It is not likely that I shall ever, on this side of the
      grave, plant onion seed again. All these things I have with me. My
      vegetables are to come after me by freight. They are booked from Simcoe
      County to Montreal; at present they are, I believe, passing through
      Schenectady. But they will arrive later all right. They were seen going
      through Detroit last week, moving west. It is the first time that I ever
      sent anything by freight anywhere. I never understood before the wonderful
      organization of the railroads. But they tell me that there is a bad
      congestion of freight down South this month. If my vegetables get tangled
      up in that there is no telling when they will arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, I am one of the legion of men&mdash;quiet, determined,
      resolute men&mdash;who went out last spring to plant the land, and who are
      now back.
    </p>
    <p>
      With me&mdash;and I am sure that I speak for all the others as well&mdash;it
      was not a question of mere pleasure; it was no love of gardening for its
      own sake that inspired us. It was a plain national duty. What we said to
      ourselves was: "This war has got to stop. The men in the trenches thus far
      have failed to stop it. Now let <i>us</i> try. The whole thing," we
      argued, "is a plain matter of food production."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we raise enough food the Germans are bound to starve. Very good. Let
      us kill them."
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose there was never a more grimly determined set of men went out
      from the cities than those who went out last May, as I did, to conquer the
      food problem. I don't mean to say that each and every one of us actually
      left the city. But we all "went forth" in the metaphorical sense. Some of
      the men cultivated back gardens; others took vacant lots; some went out
      into the suburbs; and others, like myself, went right out into the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now back. Each of us has with him his Paris Green, his hoe and the
      rest of his radish seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time has, therefore, come for a plain, clear statement of our
      experience. We have, as everybody knows, failed. We have been beaten hack
      all along the line. Our potatoes are buried in a jungle of autumn
      burdocks. Our radishes stand seven feet high, uneatable. Our tomatoes,
      when last seen, were greener than they were at the beginning of August,
      and getting greener every week. Our celery looked as delicate as a
      maidenhair fern. Our Indian corn was nine feet high with a tall feathery
      spike on top of that, but no sign of anything eatable about it from top to
      bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look back with a sigh of regret at those bright, early days in April
      when we were all buying hoes, and talking soil and waiting for the snow to
      be off the ground. The street cars, as we went up and down to our offices,
      were a busy babel of garden talk. There was a sort of farmer-like
      geniality in the air. One spoke freely to strangers. Every man with a hoe
      was a friend. Men chewed straws in their offices, and kept looking out of
      windows to pretend to themselves that they were afraid it might blow up
      rain. "Got your tomatoes in?" one man would ask another as they went up in
      the elevator. "Yes, I got mine in yesterday," the other would answer, "But
      I'm just a little afraid that this east wind may blow up a little frost.
      What we need now is growing weather." And the two men would drift off
      together from the elevator door along the corridor, their heads together
      in friendly colloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always regarded a lawyer as a man without a soul. There is one who
      lives next door to me to whom I have not spoken in five years. Yet when I
      saw him one day last spring heading for the suburbs in a pair of old
      trousers with a hoe in one hand and a box of celery plants in the other I
      felt that I loved the man. I used to think that stock-brokers were mere
      sordid calculating machines. Now that I have seen whole firms of them busy
      at the hoe, wearing old trousers that reached to their armpits and were
      tied about the waist with a polka dot necktie, I know that they are men. I
      know that there are warm hearts beating behind those trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old trousers, I say. Where on earth did they all come from in such a
      sudden fashion last spring? Everybody had them. Who would suspect that a
      man drawing a salary of ten thousand a year was keeping in reserve a pair
      of pepper-and-salt breeches, four sizes too large for him, just in case a
      war should break out against Germany! Talk of German mobilization! I doubt
      whether the organizing power was all on their side after all. At any rate
      it is estimated that fifty thousand pairs of old trousers were mobilized
      in Montreal in one week.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps it was not a case of mobilization, or deliberate preparedness.
      It was rather an illustration of the primitive instinct that is in all of
      us and that will out in "war time." Any man worth the name would wear old
      breeches all the time if the world would let him. Any man will wind a
      polka dot tie round his waist in preference to wearing patent braces. The
      makers of the ties know this. That is why they make the tie four feet
      long. And in the same way if any manufacturer of hats will put on the
      market an old fedora, with a limp rim and a mark where the ribbon used to
      be but is not&mdash;a hat guaranteed to be six years old, well weathered,
      well rained on, and certified to have been walked over by a herd of cattle&mdash;that
      man will make and deserve a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      These at least were the fashions of last May. Alas, where are they now?
      The men that wore them have relapsed again into tailor-made tweeds. They
      have put on hard new hats. They are shining their boots again. They are
      shaving again, not merely on Saturday night, but every day. They are
      sinking back into civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet those were bright times and I cannot forbear to linger on them. Nor
      the least pleasant feature was our rediscovery of the morning. My
      neighbour on the right was always up at five. My neighbour on the left was
      out and about by four. With the earliest light of day, little columns of
      smoke rose along our street from the kitchen ranges where our wives were
      making coffee for us before the servants got up. By six o'clock the street
      was alive and busy with friendly salutations. The milkman seemed a late
      comer, a poor, sluggish fellow who failed to appreciate the early hours of
      the day. A man, we found, might live through quite a little Iliad of
      adventure before going to his nine o'clock office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How will you possibly get time to put in a garden?" I asked of one of my
      neighbours during this glad period of early spring before I left for the
      country. "Time!" he exclaimed. "Why, my dear fellow, I don't have to be
      down at the warehouse till eight-thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the summer I saw the wreck of his garden, choked with weeds.
      "Your garden," I said, "is in poor shape." "Garden!" he said indignantly.
      "How on earth can I find time for a garden? Do you realize that I have to
      be down at the warehouse at eight-thirty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When I look back to our bright beginnings our failure seems hard indeed to
      understand. It is only when I survey the whole garden movement in
      melancholy retrospect that I am able to see some of the reasons for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal one, I think, is the question of the season. It appears that
      the right time to begin gardening is last year. For many things it is well
      to begin the year before last. For good results one must begin even
      sooner. Here, for example, are the directions, as I interpret them, for
      growing asparagus. Having secured a suitable piece of ground, preferably a
      deep friable loam rich in nitrogen, go out three years ago and plough or
      dig deeply. Remain a year inactive, thinking. Two years ago pulverize the
      soil thoroughly. Wait a year. As soon as last year comes set out the young
      shoots. Then spend a quiet winter doing nothing. The asparagus will then
      be ready to work at <i>this</i> year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the rock on which we were wrecked. Few of us were men of
      sufficient means to spend several years in quiet thought waiting to begin
      gardening. Yet that is, it seems, the only way to begin. Asparagus demands
      a preparation of four years. To fit oneself to grow strawberries requires
      three years. Even for such humble things as peas, beans, and lettuce the
      instructions inevitably read, "plough the soil deeply in the preceeding
      autumn." This sets up a dilemma. <i>Which</i> is the preceeding autumn? If
      a man begins gardening in the spring he is too late for last autumn and
      too early for this. On the other hand if he begins in the autumn he is
      again too late; he has missed this summer's crop. It is, therefore,
      ridiculous to begin in the autumn and impossible to begin in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was our first difficulty. But the second arose from the question of
      the soil itself. All the books and instructions insist that the selection
      of the soil is the most important part of gardening. No doubt it is. But,
      if a man has already selected his own backyard before he opens the book,
      what remedy is there? All the books lay stress on the need of "a deep,
      friable loam full of nitrogen." This I have never seen. My own plot of
      land I found on examination to contain nothing but earth. I could see no
      trace of nitrogen. I do not deny the existence of loam. There may be such
      a thing. But I am admitting now in all humility of mind that I don't know
      what loam is. Last spring my fellow gardeners and I all talked freely of
      the desirability of "a loam." My own opinion is that none of them had any
      clearer ideas about it than I had. Speaking from experience, I should say
      that the only soils are earth, mud and dirt. There are no others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I leave out the soil. In any case we were mostly forced to disregard
      it. Perhaps a more fruitful source of failure even than the lack of loam
      was the attempt to apply calculation and mathematics to gardening. Thus,
      if one cabbage will grow in one square foot of ground, how many cabbages
      will grow in ten square feet of ground? Ten? Not at all. The answer is <i>one</i>.
      You will find as a matter of practical experience that however many
      cabbages you plant in a garden plot there will be only <i>one</i> that
      will really grow. This you will presently come to speak of as <i>the </i>cabbage.
      Beside it all the others (till the caterpillars finally finish their
      existence) will look but poor, lean things. But <i>the</i> cabbage will be
      a source of pride and an object of display to visitors; in fact it would
      ultimately have grown to be a <i>real</i> cabbage, such as you buy for ten
      cents at any market, were it not that you inevitably cut it and eat it
      when it is still only half-grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This always happens to the one cabbage that is of decent size, and to the
      one tomato that shows signs of turning red (it is really a feeble
      green-pink), and to the only melon that might have lived to ripen. They
      get eaten. No one but a practised professional gardener can live and sleep
      beside a melon three-quarters ripe and a cabbage two-thirds grown without
      going out and tearing it off the stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at that it is not a bad plan to eat the stuff while you can. The most
      peculiar thing about gardening is that all of a sudden everything is too
      old to eat. Radishes change over night from delicate young shoots not
      large enough to put on the table into huge plants seven feet high with a
      root like an Irish shillelagh. If you take your eyes off a lettuce bed for
      a week the lettuces, not ready to eat when you last looked at them, have
      changed into a tall jungle of hollyhocks. Green peas are only really green
      for about two hours. Before that they are young peas; after that they are
      old peas. Cucumbers are the worst case of all. They change overnight, from
      delicate little bulbs obviously too slight and dainty to pick, to old
      cases of yellow leather filled with seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were ever to garden again, a thing which is out of the bounds of
      possibility, I should wait until a certain day and hour when all the
      plants were ripe, and then go out with a gun and shoot them all dead, so
      that they could grow no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But calculation, I repeat, is the bane of gardening. I knew, among our
      group of food producers, a party of young engineers, college men, who took
      an empty farm north of the city as the scene of their summer operations.
      They took their coats off and applied college methods. They ran out,
      first, a base line AB, and measured off from it lateral spurs MN, OP, QR,
      and so on. From these they took side angles with a theodolite so as to get
      the edges of each of the separate plots of their land absolutely correct.
      I saw them working at it all through one Saturday afternoon in May. They
      talked as they did it of the peculiar ignorance of the so-called practical
      farmer. He never&mdash;so they agreed&mdash;uses his head. He never&mdash;I
      think I have their phrase correct&mdash;stops to think. In laying out his
      ground for use, it never occurs to him to try to get the maximum result
      from a given space. If a farmer would only realize that the contents of a
      circle represent the maximum of space enclosable in a given perimeter, and
      that a circle is merely a function of its own radius, what a lot of time
      he would save.
    </p>
    <p>
      These young men that I speak of laid out their field engineer-fashion with
      little white posts at even distances. They made a blueprint of the whole
      thing as they planted it. Every corner of it was charted out. The yield
      was calculated to a nicety. They had allowed for the fact that some of the
      stuff might fail to grow by introducing what they called "a coefficient of
      error." By means of this and by reducing the variation of autumn prices to
      a mathematical curve, those men not only knew already in the middle of May
      the exact yield of their farm to within half a bushel (they allowed, they
      said, a variation of half a bushel per fifty acres), but they knew
      beforehand within a few cents the market value that they would receive.
      The figures, as I remember them, were simply amazing. It seemed incredible
      that fifty acres could produce so much. Yet there were the plain facts in
      front of one, calculated out. The thing amounted practically to a
      revolution in farming. At least it ought to have. And it would have if
      those young men had come again to hoe their field. But it turned out, most
      unfortunately, that they were busy. To their great regret they were too
      busy to come. They had been working under a free-and-easy arrangement.
      Each man was to give what time he could every Saturday. It was left to
      every man's honour to do what he could. There was no compulsion. Each man
      trusted the others to be there. In fact the thing was not only an
      experiment in food production, it was also a new departure in social
      co-operation. The first Saturday that those young men worked there were,
      so I have been told, seventy-five of them driving in white stakes and
      running lines. The next Saturday there were fifteen of them planting
      potatoes. The rest were busy. The week after that there was one man hoeing
      weeds. After that silence fell upon the deserted garden, broken only by
      the cry of the chick-a-dee and the choo-choo feeding on the waving heads
      of the thistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have indicated only two or three of the ways of failing at food
      production. There are ever so many more. What amazes me, in returning to
      the city, is to find the enormous quantities of produce of all sorts
      offered for sale in the markets. It is an odd thing that last spring, by a
      queer oversight, we never thought, any of us, of this process of
      increasing the supply. If every patriotic man would simply take a large
      basket and go to the market every day and buy all that he could carry away
      there need be no further fear of a food famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, meantime, my own vegetables are on their way. They are in a soap box
      with bars across the top, coming by freight. They weigh forty-six pounds,
      including the box. They represent the result of four months' arduous toil
      in sun, wind, and storm. Yet it is pleasant to think that I shall be able
      to feed with them some poor family of refugees during the rigour of the
      winter. Either that or give them to the hens. I certainly won't eat the
      rotten things myself.

      For some time past I have been calling upon a young lady friend at her

      Can you tell me whether the widow of a marquis is entitled to go in to

      Answer: Ha! ha! This is a thing we know&mdash;something that we <i>do</i>
      know. You put your foot in it when you asked us that. We have <i>lived</i>
      this sort of thing too long ever to make any error. The widow of a
      marquis, whom you should by rights call a marchioness dowager (but we
      overlook it&mdash;you meant no harm) is entitled (in any hotel that we
      know or frequent) to go in to dinner whenever, and as often, as she likes.
      On a dining-car the rule is the other way.

      Lexicographer asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you tell me the proper way to spell "dog"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer: Certainly. "Dog" should be spelt, properly and precisely, "dog."
      When it is used in the sense to mean not "<i>a</i> dog" or "<i>one</i>
      dog" but two or more dogs&mdash;in other words what we grammarians are
      accustomed to call the plural&mdash;it is proper to add to it the
      diphthong, <i>s</i>, pronounced with a hiss like <i>z</i> in soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all these questions of spelling your best plan is to buy a copy of
      Our Standard Dictionary, published in ten volumes, by this newspaper, at
      forty dollars.

      the Dictionary.

      I am most anxious to find out the relation of the earth's diameter to its
      circumference. Can you, or any of your readers, assist me in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer: The earth's circumference is estimated to be three decimal one
      four one five nine of its diameter, a fixed relation indicated by the
      Greek letter <i>pi</i>. If you like we will tell you what <i>pi</i> is.
      Shall we?

    </p>
    <p>
      Can you, will you, tell me what is the Sanjak of Novi Bazar?
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer. The Sanjak of Novi Bazar is bounded on the north by its northern
      frontier, cold and cheerless, and covered during the winter with deep
      snow. The east of the Sanjak occupies a more easterly position. Here the
      sun rises&mdash;at first slowly, but gathering speed as it goes. After
      having traversed the entire width of the whole Sanjak, the magnificent
      orb, slowly and regretfully, sinks into the west. On the south, where the
      soil is more fertile and where the land begins to be worth occupying, the
      Sanjak is, or will be, bounded by the British Empire.

    <h2>
      XVI. Simple Stories of Success, or How to Succeed in Life
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let me begin with a sort of parable. Many years ago when I was on the
      staff of a great public school, we engaged a new swimming master.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the most successful man in that capacity that we had had for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day it was discovered that he couldn't swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing at the edge of the swimming tank explaining the breast
      stroke to the boys in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost his balance and fell in. He was drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or no, he wasn't drowned, I remember,&mdash;he was rescued by some of the
      pupils whom he had taught to swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he was resuscitated by the boys&mdash;it was one of the things he
      had taught them&mdash;the school dismissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some of the boys who were sorry for him taught him how to swim, and
      he got a new job as a swimming master in another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time he was an utter failure. He swam well, but they said he
      couldn't <i>teach</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So his friends looked about to get him a new job. This was just at the
      time when the bicycle craze came in. They soon found the man a position as
      an instructor in bicycle riding. As he had never been on a bicycle in his
      life, he made an admirable teacher. He stood fast on the ground and said,
      "Now then, all you need is confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day he got afraid that he might be found out. So he went out to a
      quiet place and got on a bicycle, at the top of a slope, to learn to ride
      it. The bicycle ran away with him. But for the skill and daring of one of
      his pupils, who saw him and rode after him, he would have been killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story, as the reader sees, is endless. Suffice it to say that the man
      I speak of is now in an aviation school teaching people to fly. They say
      he is one of the best aviators that ever walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to all the legends and story books, the principal factor in
      success is perseverance. Personally, I think there is nothing in it. If
      anything, the truth lies the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an old motto that runs, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try
      again." This is nonsense. It ought to read, "If at first you don't
      succeed, quit, quit, at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can't do a thing, more or less, the first time you try, you will
      never do it. Try something else while there is yet time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me illustrate this with a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember, long years ago, at a little school that I attended in the
      country, we had a schoolmaster, who used perpetually to write on the
      blackboard, in a copperplate hand, the motto that I have just quoted:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "If at first you don't succeed,
    Try, try, again."
</pre>
    <p>
      He wore plain clothes and had a hard, determined face. He was studying for
      some sort of preliminary medical examination, and was saving money for a
      medical course. Every now and then he went away to the city and tried the
      examination: and he always failed. Each time he came back, he would write
      up on the blackboard:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Try, try again."
</pre>
    <p>
      And always he looked grimmer and more determined than before. The strange
      thing was that, with all his industry and determination, he would break
      out every now and then into drunkenness, and lie round the tavern at the
      crossroads, and the school would be shut for two days. Then he came back,
      more fiercely resolute than ever. Even children could see that the man's
      life was a fight. It was like the battle between Good and Evil in Milton's
      epics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, after he had tried it four times, the schoolmaster at last passed
      the examination; and he went away to the city in a suit of store clothes,
      with eight hundred dollars that he had saved up, to study medicine. Now it
      happened that he had a brother who was not a bit like himself, but was a
      sort of ne'er-do-well, always hard-up and sponging on other people, and
      never working.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the schoolmaster came to the city and his brother knew that he
      had eight hundred dollars, he came to him and got him drinking and
      persuaded him to hand over the eight hundred dollars and to let him put it
      into the Louisiana State lottery. In those days the Louisiana Lottery had
      not yet been forbidden the use of the mails, and you could buy a ticket
      for anything from one dollar up. The Grand Prize was two hundred thousand
      dollars, and the Seconds were a hundred thousand each.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the brother persuaded the schoolmaster to put the money in. He said he
      had a system for buying only the tickets with prime numbers, that won't
      divide by anything, and that it must win. He said it was a mathematical
      certainty, and he figured it out with the schoolmaster in the back room of
      a saloon, with a box of dominoes on the table to show the plan of it. He
      told the schoolmaster that he himself would only take ten per cent of what
      they made, as a commission for showing the system, and the schoolmaster
      could have the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in a mad moment, the schoolmaster handed over his roll of money, and
      that was the last he ever saw of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning when he was up he was fierce with rage and remorse for
      what he had done. He could not go back to the school, and he had no money
      to go forward. So he stayed where he was in the little hotel where he had
      got drunk, and went on drinking. He looked so fierce and unkempt that in
      the hotel they were afraid of him, and the bar-tenders watched him out of
      the corners of their eyes wondering what he would do; because they knew
      that there was only one end possible, and they waited for it to come. And
      presently it came. One of the bar-tenders went up to the schoolmaster's
      room to bring up a letter, and he found him lying on the bed with his face
      grey as ashes, and his eyes looking up at the ceiling. He was stone dead.
      Life had beaten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the strange thing was that the letter that the bartender carried up
      that morning was from the management of the Louisiana Lottery. It
      contained a draft on New York, signed by the treasurer of the State of
      Louisiana, for two hundred thousand dollars. The schoolmaster had won the
      Grand Prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above story, I am afraid, is a little gloomy. I put it down merely for
      the moral it contained, and I became so absorbed in telling it that I
      almost forgot what the moral was that it was meant to convey. But I think
      the idea is that if the schoolmaster had long before abandoned the study
      of medicine, for which he was not fitted, and gone in, let us say, for
      playing the banjo, he might have become end-man in a minstrel show. Yes,
      that was it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me pass on to other elements in success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that anybody will admit that the peculiar quality that is called
      initiative&mdash;the ability to act promptly on one's own judgement&mdash;is
      a factor of the highest importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen this illustrated two or three times in a very striking
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew, in Toronto&mdash;it is long years ago&mdash;a singularly bright
      young man whose name was Robinson. He had had some training in the iron
      and steel business, and when I knew him was on the look out for an
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met him one day in a great hurry, with a valise in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over to England," he said. "There is a firm in Liverpool that have
      advertised that they want an agent here, and I'm going over to apply for
      the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you do it by letter?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said Robinson, with a chuckle, "all the other men will
      apply by letter. I'll go right over myself and get there as soon or sooner
      than the letters. I'll be the man on the spot, and I'll get the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite right. He went over to Liverpool, and was back in a fortnight
      with English clothes and a big salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I cannot recommend his story to my friends. In fact, it should not be
      told too freely. It is apt to be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember once telling this story of Robinson to a young man called
      Tomlinson who was out of a job. Tomlinson had a head two sizes too big,
      and a face like a bun. He had lost three jobs in a bank and two in a
      broker's office, but he knew his work, and on paper he looked a good man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him about Robinson, to encourage him, and the story made a great
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, that was a great scheme, eh?" he kept repeating. He had no command
      of words, and always said the same thing over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later I met Tomlinson in the street with a valise in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm off to Mexico," he answered. "They're advertising for a Canadian
      teller for a bank in Tuscapulco. I've sent my credentials down, and I'm
      going to follow them right up in person. In a thing like this, the
      personal element is everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tomlinson went down to Mexico and he travelled by sea to Mexico City,
      and then with a mule train to Tuscapulco. But the mails, with his
      credentials, went by land and got there two days ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tomlinson got to Tuscapulco he went into the bank and he spoke to the
      junior manager and told him what he came for. "I'm awfully sorry," the
      junior manager said, "I'm afraid that this post has just been filled."
      Then he went into an inner room to talk with the manager. "The tellership
      that you wanted a Canadian for," he asked, "didn't you say that you have a
      man already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the manager, "a brilliant young fellow from Toronto; his name
      is Tomlinson, I have his credentials here&mdash;a first-class man. I've
      wired him to come right along, at our expense, and we'll keep the job open
      for him ten days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a young man outside," said the junior, "who wants to apply for
      the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Outside?" exclaimed the manager. "How did he get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Came in on the mule train this morning: says he can do the work and wants
      the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's he like?" asked the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      The junior shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty dusty looking customer," he said. "Shifty looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same old story," murmured the manager. "It's odd how these fellows drift
      down here, isn't it? Up to something crooked at home, I suppose.
      Understands the working of a bank, eh? I guess he understands it a little
      too well for my taste. No, no," he continued, tapping the papers that lay
      on the table, "now that we've got a first-class man like Tomlinson, let's
      hang on to him. We can easily wait ten days, and the cost of the journey
      is nothing to the bank as compared with getting a man of Tomlinson's
      stamp. And, by the way, you might telephone to the Chief of Police and get
      him to see to it that this loafer gets out of town straight off."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Chief of Police shut up Tomlinson in the calaboose and then sent
      him down to Mexico City under a guard. By the time the police were done
      with him he was dead broke, and it took him four months to get back to
      Toronto; when he got there, the place in Mexico had been filled long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I can imagine that some of my readers might suggest that I have
      hitherto been dealing only with success in a very limited way, and that
      more interest would lie in discussing how the really great fortunes are
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody feels an instinctive interest in knowing how our great captains
      of industry, our financiers and railroad magnates made their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the explanation is really a very simple one. There is, in fact, only
      one way to amass a huge fortune in business or railway management. One
      must begin at the bottom. One must mount the ladder from the lowest rung.
      But this lowest rung is everything. Any man who can stand upon it with his
      foot well poised, his head erect, his arms braced and his eye directed
      upward, will inevitably mount to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all&mdash;I say this as a kind of afterthought in conclusion&mdash;why
      bother with success at all? I have observed that the successful people get
      very little real enjoyment out of life. In fact the contrary is true. If I
      had to choose&mdash;with an eye to having a really pleasant life&mdash;between
      success and ruin, I should prefer ruin every time. I have several friends
      who are completely ruined&mdash;some two or three times&mdash;in a large
      way of course; and I find that if I want to get a really good dinner,
      where the champagne is just as it ought to be, and where hospitality is
      unhindered by mean thoughts of expense, I can get it best at the house of
      a ruined man.

      XVII. In Dry Toronto
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A LOCAL STUDY OF A UNIVERSAL TOPIC
    </h3>
    <p>
      Note.&mdash;Our readers&mdash;our numerous readers&mdash;who live in
      Equatorial Africa, may read this under the title "In Dry Timbucto"; those
      who live in Central America will kindly call it "In Dry Tehauntepec."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been, for aught I know, the change from a wet to a dry
      atmosphere. I am told that, biologically, such things profoundly affect
      the human system.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate I found it impossible that night&mdash;I was on the train from
      Montreal to Toronto&mdash;to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiar wakefulness seemed to have seized upon me, which appeared,
      moreover, to afflict the other passengers as well. In the darkness of the
      car I could distinctly hear them groaning at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they ill?" I asked, through the curtains, of the porter as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," he said, "they're not ill. Those is the Toronto passengers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All in this car?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All except that gen'lman you may have heard singing in the smoking
      compartment. He's booked through to Chicago."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as is usual in such cases, sleep came at last with unusual heaviness.
      I seemed obliterated from the world till, all of a sudden, I found myself,
      as it were, up and dressed and seated in the observation car at the back
      of the train, awaiting my arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this Toronto?" I asked of the Pullman conductor, as I peered through
      the window of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor rubbed the pane with his finger and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do we stop here?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we do this morning," he answered. "I think I heard the conductor
      say that they have a lot of milk cans to put off here this morning. I'll
      just go and find out, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop here!" broke in an irascible-looking gentleman in a grey tweed suit
      who was sitting in the next chair to mine. "Do they <i>stop</i> here? I
      should say they did indeed. Don't you know," he added, turning to the
      Pullman conductor, "that any train is <i>compelled</i> to stop here.
      There's a by-law, a municipal by-law of the City of Toronto, <i>compelling</i>
      every train to stop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know it," said the conductor humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say," continued the irascible gentleman, "that you have
      never read the by-laws of the City of Toronto?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ignorance of these fellows," said the man in grey tweed, swinging his
      chair round again towards me. "We ought to have a by-law to compel them to
      read the by-laws. I must start an agitation for it at once." Here he took
      out a little red notebook and wrote something in it, murmuring, "We need a
      new agitation anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he shut the book up with a snap. I noticed that there was a sort
      of peculiar alacrity in everything he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, sir," he said, "have, of course, read our municipal by-laws?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," I answered. "Splendid, aren't they? They read like a romance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are most flattering to our city," said the irascible gentleman with a
      bow. "Yet you, sir, I take it, are not from Toronto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I answered, as humbly as I could. "I'm from Montreal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the gentleman, as he sat back and took a thorough look at me.
      "From Montreal? Are you drunk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I replied. "I don't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are <i>suffering</i> for a drink," said my new acquaintance
      eagerly. "You need it, eh? You feel already a kind of craving, eh what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I answered. "The fact is it's rather early in the morning&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so," broke in the irascible gentleman, "but I understand that in
      Montreal all the saloons are open at seven, and even at that hour are
      crowded, sir, crowded."
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that has been exaggerated," I said. "In fact, we always try to
      avoid crowding and jostling as far as possible. It is generally
      understood, as a matter of politeness, that the first place in the line is
      given to the clergy, the Board of Trade, and the heads of the
      universities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it conceivable!" said the gentleman in grey. "One moment, please, till
      I make a note. 'All clergy&mdash;I think you said <i>all</i>, did you not?&mdash;drunk
      at seven in the morning.' Deplorable! But here we are at the Union Station&mdash;commodious,
      is it not? Justly admired, in fact, all over the known world. Observe," he
      continued as we alighted from the train and made our way into the station,
      "the upstairs and the downstairs, connected by flights of stairs; quite
      unique and most convenient: if you don't meet your friends downstairs all
      you have to do is to look upstairs. If they are not there, you simply come
      down again. But stop, you are going to walk up the street? I'll go with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outer door of the station&mdash;just as I had remembered it&mdash;stood
      a group of hotel bus-men and porters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how changed!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were like men blasted by a great sorrow. One, with his back turned,
      was leaning against a post, his head buried on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince George Hotel," he groaned at intervals. "Prince George Hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another was bending over a little handrail, his head sunk, his arms almost
      trailing to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>King Edward</i>," he sobbed, "<i>King Edward</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      A third, seated on a stool, looked feebly up, with tears visible in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walker House," he moaned. "First-class accommodation for&mdash;" then he
      broke down and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this handbag," I said to one of the men, "to the <i>Prince George</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man ceased his groaning for a moment and turned to me with something
      like passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you come to <i>us</i>?" he protested. "Why not go to one of the
      others. Go to <i>him</i>," he added, as he stirred with his foot a
      miserable being who lay huddled on the ground and murmured at intervals, "<i>Queen's</i>!
      Queen's Hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      But my new friend, who stood at my elbow, came to my rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take his bags," he said, "you've got to. You know the by-law. Take it or
      I'll call a policeman. You know <i>me</i>. My name's Narrowpath. I'm on
      the council."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man touched his hat and took the bag with a murmured apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along," said my companion, whom I now perceived to be a person of
      dignity and civic importance. "I'll walk up with you, and show you the
      city as we go."
    </p>
    <p>
      We had hardly got well upon the street before I realized the enormous
      change that total prohibition had effected. Everywhere were the bright
      smiling faces of working people, laughing and singing at their tasks, and,
      early though it was, cracking jokes and asking one another riddles as they
      worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed one man, evidently a city employe, in a rough white suit, busily
      cleaning the street with a broom and singing to himself: "How does the
      little busy bee improve the shining hour." Another employe, who was
      handling a little hose, was singing, "Little drops of water, little grains
      of sand, Tra, la, la, la, <i>la</i> la, Prohibition's grand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they sing?" I asked. "Are they crazy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sing?" said Mr Narrowpath. "They can't help it. They haven't had a drink
      of whisky for four months."
    </p>
    <p>
      A coal cart went by with a driver, no longer grimy and smudged, but neatly
      dressed with a high white collar and a white silk tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      My companion pointed at him as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hasn't had a glass of beer for four months," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notice the difference. That man's work is now a pleasure to him. He used
      to spend all his evenings sitting round in the back parlours of the
      saloons beside the stove. Now what do you think he does?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loads up his cart with coal and goes for a drive&mdash;out in the
      country. Ah, sir, you who live still under the curse of the whisky traffic
      little know what a pleasure work itself becomes when drink and all that
      goes with it is eliminated. Do you see that man, on the other side of the
      street, with the tool bag?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I said, "a plumber, is he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, a plumber. Used to drink heavily&mdash;couldn't keep a job more
      than a week. Now, you can't drag him from his work. Came to my house to
      fix a pipe under the kitchen sink&mdash;wouldn't quit at six o'clock. Got
      in under the sink and begged to be allowed to stay&mdash;said he hated to
      go home. We had to drag him out with a rope. But here we are at your
      hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how changed the place seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our feet echoed on the flagstones of the deserted rotunda.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the office desk sat a clerk, silent and melancholy, reading the Bible.
      He put a marker in the book and closed it, murmuring "Leviticus Two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have a room," I asked, "on the first floor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear welled up into the clerk's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can have the whole first floor," he said, and he added, with a half
      sob, "and the second, too, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help contrasting his manner with what it was in the old days,
      when the mere mention of a room used to throw him into a fit of passion,
      and when he used to tell me that I could have a cot on the roof till
      Tuesday, and after that, perhaps, a bed in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things had changed indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I get breakfast in the grill room?" I inquired of the melancholy
      clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no grill room," he answered. "What would you like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, some sort of eggs," I said, "and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk reached down below his desk and handed me a hard-boiled egg with
      the shell off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's your egg," he said. "And there's ice water there at the end of the
      desk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat back in his chair and went on reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand," said Mr Narrowpath, who still stood at my elbow.
      "All that elaborate grill room breakfast business was just a mere relic of
      the drinking days&mdash;sheer waste of time and loss of efficiency. Go on
      and eat your egg. Eaten it? Now, don't you feel efficient? What more do
      you want? Comfort, you say? My dear sir! more men have been ruined by
      comfort&mdash;Great heavens, comfort! The most dangerous, deadly drug that
      ever undermined the human race. But, here, drink your water. Now you're
      ready to go and do your business, if you have any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," I protested, "it's still only half-past seven in the morning&mdash;no
      offices will be open&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open!" exclaimed Mr. Narrowpath. "Why! they all open at daybreak now."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had, it is true, a certain amount of business before me, though of no
      very intricate or elaborate kind&mdash;a few simple arrangements with the
      head of a publishing house such as it falls to my lot to make every now
      and then. Yet in the old and unregenerate days it used to take all day to
      do it: the wicked thing that we used to call a comfortable breakfast in
      the hotel grill room somehow carried one on to about ten o'clock in the
      morning. Breakfast brought with it the need of a cigar for digestion's
      sake and with that, for very restfulness, a certain perusal of the <i>Toronto
      Globe</i>, properly corrected and rectified by a look through the <i>Toronto
      Mail</i>. After that it had been my practice to stroll along to my
      publishers' office at about eleven-thirty, transact my business, over a
      cigar, with the genial gentleman at the head of it, and then accept his
      invitation to lunch, with the feeling that a man who has put in a hard and
      strenuous morning's work is entitled to a few hours of relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am inclined to think that in those reprehensible bygone times, many
      other people did their business in this same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think," I said to Mr. Narrowpath musingly, "that my publisher
      will be up as early as this. He's a comfortable sort of man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" said Mr. Narrowpath. "Not at work at half-past seven! In
      Toronto! The thing's absurd. Where is the office? Richmond Street? Come
      along, I'll go with you. I've always a great liking for attending to other
      people's business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you have," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's our way here," said Mr. Narrowpath with a wave of his hand. "Every
      man's business, as we see it, is everybody else's business. Come along,
      you'll be surprised how quickly your business will be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Narrowpath was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      My publishers' office, as we entered it, seemed a changed place. Activity
      and efficiency were stamped all over it. My good friend the publisher was
      not only there, but there with his coat off, inordinately busy, bawling
      orders&mdash;evidently meant for a printing room&mdash;through a speaking
      tube. "Yes," he was shouting, "put WHISKY in black letter capitals, old
      English, double size, set it up to look attractive, with the legend MADE
      IN TORONTO in long clear type underneath&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," he said, as he broke off for a moment. "We've a lot of stuff
      going through the press this morning&mdash;a big distillery catalogue that
      we are rushing through. We're doing all we can, Mr. Narrowpath," he
      continued, speaking with the deference due to a member of the City
      Council, "to boom Toronto as a Whisky Centre."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, quite right!" said my companion, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, professor," added the publisher, speaking with rapidity, "your
      contract is all here&mdash;only needs signing. I won't keep you more than
      a moment&mdash;write your name here. Miss Sniggins will you please witness
      this so help you God how's everything in Montreal good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty quick, wasn't it?" said Mr. Narrowpath, as we stood in the street
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful!" I said, feeling almost dazed. "Why, I shall be able to catch
      the morning train back again to Montreal&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely. Just what everybody finds. Business done in no time. Men who
      used to spend whole days here clear out now in fifteen minutes. I knew a
      man whose business efficiency has so increased under our new regime that
      he says he wouldn't spend more than five minutes in Toronto if he were
      paid to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is this?" I asked as we were brought to a pause in our walk at a
      street crossing by a great block of vehicles. "What are all these drays?
      Surely, those look like barrels of whisky!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they are," said Mr. Narrowpath proudly. "<i>Export</i> whisky. Fine
      sight, isn't it? Must be what?&mdash;twenty&mdash;twenty-five&mdash;loads
      of it. This place, sir, mark my words, is going to prove, with its new
      energy and enterprise, one of the greatest seats of the distillery
      business, in fact, <i>the</i> whisky capital of the North&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought," I interrupted, much puzzled, "that whisky was prohibited
      here since last September?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Export whisky&mdash;<i>export</i>, my dear sir," corrected Mr.
      Narrowpath. "We don't interfere, we have never, so far as I know, proposed
      to interfere with any man's right to make and export whisky. That, sir, is
      a plain matter of business; morality doesn't enter into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," I answered. "But will you please tell me what is the meaning of
      this other crowd of drays coming in the opposite direction? Surely, those
      are beer barrels, are they not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sense they are," admitted Mr. Narrowpath. "That is, they are <i>import</i>
      beer. It comes in from some other province. It was, I imagine, made in
      this city (our breweries, sir, are second to none), but the sin of <i>selling</i>
      it"&mdash;here Mr. Narrowpath raised his hat from his head and stood for a
      moment in a reverential attitude&mdash;"rests on the heads of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      The press of vehicles had now thinned out and we moved on, my guide still
      explaining in some detail the distinction between business principles and
      moral principles, between whisky as a curse and whisky as a source of
      profit, which I found myself unable to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I ventured to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet it seems almost a pity," I said, "that with all this beer and whisky
      around an unregenerate sinner like myself should be prohibited from
      getting a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A drink!" exclaimed Mr. Narrowpath. "Well, I should say so. Come right in
      here. You can have anything you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      We stepped through a street door into a large, long room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," I exclaimed in surprise, "this is a bar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" said my friend. "The <i>bar</i> in this province is forbidden.
      We've done with the foul thing for ever. This is an Import Shipping
      Company's Delivery Office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this long counter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a counter, it's a desk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that bar-tender in his white jacket&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut! Tut! He's not a bar-tender. He's an Import Goods Delivery Clerk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll you have, gentlemen," said the Import Clerk, polishing a glass as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two whisky and sodas," said my friend, "long ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Import Clerk mixed the drinks and set them on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to take one, but he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One minute, sir," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took up a desk telephone that stood beside him and I heard him
      calling up Montreal. "Hullo, Montreal! Is that Montreal? Well, say, I've
      just received an offer here for two whisky and sodas at sixty cents, shall
      I close with it? All right, gentlemen, Montreal has effected the sale.
      There you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreadful, isn't it?" said Mr. Narrowpath. "The sunken, depraved condition
      of your City of Montreal; actually <i>selling</i> whisky. Deplorable!" and
      with that he buried his face in the bubbles of the whisky and soda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Narrowpath," I said, "would you mind telling me something? I fear I
      am a little confused, after what I have seen here, as to what your new
      legislation has been. You have not then, I understand, prohibited the
      making of whisky?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, we see no harm in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the sale of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Mr. Narrowpath, "not if sold <i>properly</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the drinking of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, that least of all. We attach no harm whatever, under our law, to
      the mere drinking of whisky."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you tell me then," I asked, "since you have not forbidden the
      making, nor the selling, nor the buying, nor the drinking of whisky, just
      what it is that you have prohibited? What is the difference between
      Montreal and Toronto?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Narrowpath put down his glass on the "desk" in front of him. He gazed
      at me with open-mouthed astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toronto?" he gasped. "Montreal and Toronto! The difference between
      Montreal and Toronto! My dear sir&mdash;Toronto&mdash;Toronto&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood waiting for him to explain. But as I did so I seemed to become
      aware that a voice, not Mr. Narrowpath's but a voice close at my ear, was
      repeating "Toronto&mdash;Toronto&mdash;Toronto&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat up with a start&mdash;still in my berth in the Pullman car&mdash;with
      the voice of the porter calling through the curtains "Toronto! Toronto!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So! It had only been a dream. I pulled up the blind and looked out of the
      window and there was the good old city, with the bright sun sparkling on
      its church spires and on the bay spread out at its feet. It looked quite
      unchanged: just the same pleasant old place, as cheerful, as
      self-conceited, as kindly, as hospitable, as quarrelsome, as wholesome, as
      moral and as loyal and as disagreeable as it always was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Porter," I said, "is it true that there is prohibition here now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't heard of it," he said.

    <h2>
      XVIII. Merry Christmas
    </h2>
    <p>
      "My Dear Young Friend," said Father Time, as he laid his hand gently upon
      my shoulder, "you are entirely wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I looked up over my shoulder from the table at which I was sitting
      and I saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had known, or felt, for at least the last half-hour that he was
      standing somewhere near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have had, I do not doubt, good reader, more than once that strange
      uncanny feeling that there is some one unseen standing beside you, in a
      darkened room, let us say, with a dying fire, when the night has grown
      late, and the October wind sounds low outside, and when, through the thin
      curtain that we call Reality, the Unseen World starts for a moment clear
      upon our dreaming sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      You <i>have</i> had it? Yes, I know you have. Never mind telling me about
      it. Stop. I don't want to hear about that strange presentiment you had the
      night your Aunt Eliza broke her leg. Don't let's bother with <i>your</i>
      experience. I want to tell mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite mistaken, my dear young friend," repeated Father Time,
      "quite wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Young</i> friend?" I said, my mind, as one's mind is apt to in such a
      case, running to an unimportant detail. "Why do you call me young?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pardon," he answered gently&mdash;he had a gentle way with him, had
      Father Time. "The fault is in my failing eyes. I took you at first sight
      for something under a hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under a hundred?" I expostulated. "Well, I should think so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pardon again," said Time, "the fault is in my failing memory. I
      forgot. You seldom pass that nowadays, do you? Your life is very short of
      late."
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him breathe a wistful hollow sigh. Very ancient and dim he seemed
      as he stood beside me. But I did not turn to look upon him. I had no need
      to. I knew his form, in the inner and clearer sight of things, as well as
      every human being knows by innate instinct, the Unseen face and form of
      Father Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hear him murmuring beside me, "Short&mdash;short, your life is
      short"; till the sound of it seemed to mingle with the measured ticking of
      a clock somewhere in the silent house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I remembered what he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that I am wrong?" I asked. "And how can you tell what I
      was thinking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said it out loud," answered Father Time. "But it wouldn't have
      mattered, anyway. You said that Christmas was all played out and done
      with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I admitted, "that's what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what makes you think that?" he questioned, stooping, so it seemed to
      me, still further over my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," I answered, "the trouble is this. I've been sitting here for hours,
      sitting till goodness only knows how far into the night, trying to think
      out something to write for a Christmas story. And it won't go. It can't be
      done&mdash;not in these awful days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Christmas Story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You see, Father Time," I explained, glad with a foolish little
      vanity of my trade to be able to tell him something that I thought
      enlightening, "all the Christmas stuff&mdash;stories and jokes and
      pictures&mdash;is all done, you know, in October."
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it would have surprised him, but I was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," he said, "not till October! What a rush! How well I remember in
      Ancient Egypt&mdash;as I think you call it&mdash;seeing them getting out
      their Christmas things, all cut in hieroglyphics, always two or three
      years ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two or three years!" I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh," said Time, "that was nothing. Why in Babylon they used to get
      their Christmas jokes ready&mdash;all baked in clay&mdash;a whole Solar
      eclipse ahead of Christmas. They said, I think, that the public preferred
      them so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egypt?" I said. "Babylon? But surely, Father Time, there was no Christmas
      in those days. I thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," he interrupted gravely, "don't you know that there has
      always been Christmas?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I was silent. Father Time had moved across the room and stood beside the
      fireplace, leaning on the mantelpiece. The little wreaths of smoke from
      the fading fire seemed to mingle with his shadowy outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said presently, "what is it that is wrong with Christmas?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," I answered, "all the romance, the joy, the beauty of it has gone,
      crushed and killed by the greed of commerce and the horrors of war. I am
      not, as you thought I was, a hundred years old, but I can conjure up, as
      anybody can, a picture of Christmas in the good old days of a hundred
      years ago: the quaint old-fashioned houses, standing deep among the
      evergreens, with the light twinkling from the windows on the snow; the
      warmth and comfort within; the great fire roaring on the hearth; the merry
      guests grouped about its blaze and the little children with their eyes
      dancing in the Christmas fire-light, waiting for Father Christmas in his
      fine mummery of red and white and cotton wool to hand the presents from
      the yule-tide tree. I can see it," I added, "as if it were yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was but yesterday," said Father Time, and his voice seemed to soften
      with the memory of bygone years. "I remember it well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," I continued, "that was Christmas indeed. Give me back such days as
      those, with the old good cheer, the old stage coaches and the gabled inns
      and the warm red wine, the snapdragon and the Christmas-tree, and I'll
      believe again in Christmas, yes, in Father Christmas himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe in him?" said Time quietly. "You may well do that. He happens to
      be standing outside in the street at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Outside?" I exclaimed. "Why don't he come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's afraid to," said Father Time. "He's frightened and he daren't come
      in unless you ask him. May I call him in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I signified assent, and Father Time went to the window for a moment and
      beckoned into the darkened street. Then I heard footsteps, clumsy and
      hesitant they seemed, upon the stairs. And in a moment a figure stood
      framed in the doorway&mdash;the figure of Father Christmas. He stood
      shuffling his feet, a timid, apologetic look upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      How changed he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had known in my mind's eye, from childhood up, the face and form of
      Father Christmas as well as that of Old Time himself. Everybody knows, or
      once knew him&mdash;a jolly little rounded man, with a great muffler wound
      about him, a packet of toys upon his back and with such merry, twinkling
      eyes and rosy cheeks as are only given by the touch of the driving snow
      and the rude fun of the North Wind. Why, there was once a time, not yet so
      long ago, when the very sound of his sleigh-bells sent the blood running
      warm to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now how changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All draggled with the mud and rain he stood, as if no house had sheltered
      him these three years past. His old red jersey was tattered in a dozen
      places, his muffler frayed and ravelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bundle of toys that he dragged with him in a net seemed wet and worn
      till the cardboard boxes gaped asunder. There were boxes among them, I
      vow, that he must have been carrying these three past years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most of all I noted the change that had come over the face of Father
      Christmas. The old brave look of cheery confidence was gone. The smile
      that had beamed responsive to the laughing eyes of countless children
      around unnumbered Christmas-trees was there no more. And in the place of
      it there showed a look of timid apology, of apprehensiveness, as of one
      who has asked in vain the warmth and shelter of a human home&mdash;such a
      look as the harsh cruelty of this world has stamped upon the faces of its
      outcasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      So stood Father Christmas shuffling upon the threshold, fumbling his poor
      tattered hat in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I come in?" he said, his eyes appealingly on Father Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said Time. He turned to speak to me, "Your room is dark. Turn up
      the lights. He's used to light, bright light and plenty of it. The dark
      has frightened him these three years past."
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned up the lights and the bright glare revealed all the more cruelly
      the tattered figure before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Christmas advanced a timid step across the floor. Then he paused,
      as if in sudden fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this floor mined?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Time soothingly. And to me he added in a murmured whisper,
      "He's afraid. He was blown up in a mine in No Man's Land between the
      trenches at Christmas-time in 1914. It broke his nerve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I put my toys on that machine gun?" asked Father Christmas timidly.
      "It will help to keep them dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a machine gun," said Time gently. "See, it is only a pile of
      books upon the sofa." And to me he whispered, "They turned a machine gun
      on him in the streets of Warsaw. He thinks he sees them everywhere since
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, Father Christmas," I said, speaking as cheerily as I
      could, while I rose and stirred the fire into a blaze. "There are no
      machine guns here and there are no mines. This is but the house of a poor
      writer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Father Christmas, lowering his tattered hat still further and
      attempting something of a humble bow, "a writer? Are you Hans Andersen,
      perhaps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a great writer, I do not doubt," said the old man, with a humble
      courtesy that he had learned, it well may be, centuries ago in the
      yule-tide season of his northern home. "The world owes much to its great
      books. I carry some of the greatest with me always. I have them here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He began fumbling among the limp and tattered packages that he carried.
      "Look! <i>The House that Jack Built</i>&mdash;a marvellous, deep thing,
      sir&mdash;and this, <i>The Babes in the Wood</i>. Will you take it, sir? A
      poor present, but a present still&mdash;not so long ago I gave them in
      thousands every Christmas-time. None seem to want them now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked appealingly towards Father Time, as the weak may look towards
      the strong, for help and guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None want them now," he repeated, and I could see the tears start in his
      eyes. "Why is it so? Has the world forgotten its sympathy with the lost
      children wandering in the wood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the world," I heard Time murmur with a sigh, "is wandering in the
      wood." But out loud he spoke to Father Christmas in cheery admonition,
      "Tut, tut, good Christmas," he said, "you must cheer up. Here, sit in this
      chair the biggest one; so&mdash;beside the fire. Let us stir it to a
      blaze; more wood, that's better. And listen, good old Friend, to the wind
      outside&mdash;almost a Christmas wind, is it not? Merry and boisterous
      enough, for all the evil times it stirs among."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Christmas seated himself beside the fire, his hands outstretched
      towards the flames. Something of his old-time cheeriness seemed to flicker
      across his features as he warmed himself at the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's better," he murmured. "I was cold, sir, cold, chilled to the bone.
      Of old I never felt it so; no matter what the wind, the world seemed warm
      about me. Why is it not so now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Time, speaking low in a whisper for my ear alone, "how
      sunk and broken he is? Will you not help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gladly," I answered, "if I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All can," said Father Time, "every one of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Christmas had turned towards me a questioning eye, in which,
      however, there seemed to revive some little gleam of merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, perhaps," he asked half timidly, "schnapps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Schnapps?" I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, schnapps. A glass of it to drink your health might warm my heart
      again, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," I said, "something to drink?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His one failing," whispered Time, "if it is one. Forgive it him. He was
      used to it for centuries. Give it him if you have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I keep a little in the house," I said reluctantly perhaps, "in case of
      illness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, tut," said Father Time, as something as near as could be to a smile
      passed over his shadowy face. "In case of illness! They used to say that
      in ancient Babylon. Here, let me pour it for him. Drink, Father Christmas,
      drink!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Marvellous it was to see the old man smack his lips as he drank his glass
      of liquor neat after the fashion of old Norway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marvellous, too, to see the way in which, with the warmth of the fire and
      the generous glow of the spirits, his face changed and brightened till the
      old-time cheerfulness beamed again upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about him, as it were, with a new and growing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pleasant room," he said. "And what better, sir, than the wind without
      and a brave fire within!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his eye fell upon the mantelpiece, where lay among the litter of
      books and pipes a little toy horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Father Christmas almost gayly, "children in the house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One," I answered, "the sweetest boy in all the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be bound he is!" said Father Christmas and he broke now into a merry
      laugh that did one's heart good to hear. "They all are! Lord bless me! The
      number that I have seen, and each and every one&mdash;and quite right too&mdash;the
      sweetest child in all the world. And how old, do you say? Two and a half
      all but two months except a week? The very sweetest age of all, I'll bet
      you say, eh, what? They all do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old man broke again into such a jolly chuckling of laughter that
      his snow-white locks shook upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But stop a bit," he added. "This horse is broken. Tut, tut, a hind leg
      nearly off. This won't do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the toy in his lap in a moment, mending it. It was wonderful to
      see, for all his age, how deft his fingers were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time," he said, and it was amusing to note that his voice had assumed
      almost an authoritative tone, "reach me that piece of string. That's
      right. Here, hold your finger across the knot. There! Now, then, a bit of
      beeswax. What? No beeswax? Tut, tut, how ill-supplied your houses are
      to-day. How can you mend toys, sir, without beeswax? Still, it will stand
      up now."
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to murmur by best thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Father Christmas waved my gratitude aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," he said, "that's nothing. That's my life. Perhaps the little
      boy would like a book too. I have them here in the packet. Here, sir, <i>Jack
      and the Bean Stalk</i>, most profound thing. I read it to myself often
      still. How damp it is! Pray, sir, will you let me dry my books before your
      fire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only too willingly," I said. "How wet and torn they are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Christmas had risen from his chair and was fumbling among his
      tattered packages, taking from them his children's books, all limp and
      draggled from the rain and wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All wet and torn!" he murmured, and his voice sank again into sadness. "I
      have carried them these three years past. Look! These were for little
      children in Belgium and in Serbia. Can I get them to them, think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Time gently shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But presently, perhaps," said Father Christmas, "if I dry and mend them.
      Look, some of them were inscribed already! This one, see you, was written
      '<i>With father's love</i>.' Why has it never come to him? Is it rain or
      tears upon the page?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood bowed over his little books, his hands trembling as he turned the
      pages. Then he looked up, the old fear upon his face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sound!" he said. "Listen! It is guns&mdash;I hear them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," I said, "it is nothing. Only a car passing in the street below."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen," he said. "Hear that again&mdash;voices crying!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," I answered, "not voices, only the night wind among the trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children's voices!" he exclaimed. "I hear them everywhere&mdash;they
      come to me in every wind&mdash;and I see them as I wander in the night and
      storm&mdash;my children&mdash;torn and dying in the trenches&mdash;beaten
      into the ground&mdash;I hear them crying from the hospitals&mdash;each one
      to me, still as I knew him once, a little child. Time, Time," he cried,
      reaching out his arms in appeal, "give me back my children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do not die in vain," Time murmured gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christmas only moaned in answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me back my children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sank down upon his pile of books and toys, his head buried in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Time, "his heart is breaking, and will you not help him if
      you can?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only too gladly," I replied. "But what is there to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," said Father Time, "listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before me grave and solemn, a shadowy figure but half seen though
      he was close beside me. The fire-light had died down, and through the
      curtained windows there came already the first dim brightening of dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world that once you knew," said Father Time, "seems broken and
      destroyed about you. You must not let them know&mdash;the children. The
      cruelty and the horror and the hate that racks the world to-day&mdash;keep
      it from them. Some day <i>he</i> will know"&mdash;here Time pointed to the
      prostrate form of Father Christmas&mdash;"that his children, that once
      were, have not died in vain: that from their sacrifice shall come a
      nobler, better world for all to live in, a world where countless happy
      children shall hold bright their memory for ever. But for the children of
      To-day, save and spare them all you can from the evil hate and horror of
      the war. Later they will know and understand. Not yet. Give them back
      their Merry Christmas and its kind thoughts, and its Christmas charity,
      till later on there shall be with it again Peace upon Earth Good Will
      towards Men."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice ceased. It seemed to vanish, as it were, in the sighing of the
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up. Father Time and Christmas had vanished from the room. The
      fire was low and the day was breaking visibly outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us begin," I murmured. "I will mend this broken horse."
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
